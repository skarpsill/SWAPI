## Remarks

This property supports scaling for high resolution screens with high resolution operating system scaling options.

The array of strings for the paths to the image files can contain icons of the following sizes:

- 20 x 20 pixels
- 32 x 32 pixels
- 40 x 40 pixels
- 64 x 64 pixels
- 96 x 96 pixels
- 128 x128 pixels

Each image file (**.bmp**or**.png**) contains a single icon. Each icon should use a 256-color palette.

The order in which you specify the icons must be the same for this property and[ICommandGroup::IconList](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ICommandGroup~IconList.html). For example, if you specify an array of paths to 20 x 20 pixels, 32 x 32 pixels, and 40 x 40 pixels icons for this property, then you must specify an array of paths to 20 x 20 pixels, 32 x 32 pixels, and 40 x 40 pixels icons for ICommandGroup::IconList.
