Gets or sets the layer for this sketch point.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

Property Layer As System.String
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISketchPoint
Dim value As System.String

instance.Layer = value

value = instance.Layer
```

### C#

```csharp
System.string Layer {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

   System.String^ get();

}
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Property Value

Name of the layer for this sketch point

## VBA Syntax

See

[SketchPoint::Layer](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~SketchPoint~Layer.html)

.

## Remarks

Layers are only supported in drawing documents.

Every sketch point is on a layer. Sketch points can be created on a specific layer in drawings.

The return value may be an empty string because an older document may not contain layers. Also, this can occur if sketch points were generated in a new document that has no layers defined.
