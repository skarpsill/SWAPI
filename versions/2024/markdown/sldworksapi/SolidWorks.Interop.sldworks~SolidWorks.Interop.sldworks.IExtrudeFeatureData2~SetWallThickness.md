# SetWallThickness Method (IExtrudeFeatureData2)

Sets the wall thickness of the thin extrusion feature in a forward or reverse direction.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub SetWallThickness( _
   ByVal Forward As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal WallThickness As System.Double _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IExtrudeFeatureData2
Dim Forward As System.Boolean
Dim WallThickness As System.Double

instance.SetWallThickness(Forward, WallThickness)
```

### C#

```csharp
void SetWallThickness(
   System.bool Forward,
   System.double WallThickness
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void SetWallThickness(
   System.bool Forward,
   System.double WallThickness
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Forward`: True for forward direction, false for reverse
- `WallThickness`: True for forward feature direction, false for reverse

## VBA Syntax

See

[ExtrudeFeatureData2::SetWallThickness](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~ExtrudeFeatureData2~SetWallThickness.html)

.

## Remarks

This method is relevant only for thin features.
