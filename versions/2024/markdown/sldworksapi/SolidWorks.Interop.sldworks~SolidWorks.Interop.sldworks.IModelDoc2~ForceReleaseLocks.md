# ForceReleaseLocks Method (IModelDoc2)

Releases the locks that a file system places on a file when it is opened and detaches that file from the file system.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function ForceReleaseLocks() As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IModelDoc2
Dim value As System.Integer

value = instance.ForceReleaseLocks()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int ForceReleaseLocks()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.int ForceReleaseLocks();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

1 if locks are released, 0 if not

## VBA Syntax

See

[ModelDoc2::ForceReleaseLocks](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~ModelDoc2~ForceReleaseLocks.html)

.

## Remarks

This method only supports part and assembly documents; it does not support drawing documents. See[ISldWorks::CloseAndReopen](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~CloseAndReopen.html)for details about closing and reopening a drawing document without unloading its references from memory.

You must call[IModelDoc2::ReloadOrReplace](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~ReloadOrReplace.html)after calling IModelDoc2::ForceReleaseLocks to re-attach the detached file to the file system. If you do not call IModelDoc2::ReloadOrReplace after calling IModelDoc2::ForceReleaseLocks, then you will experience problems with OLE objects (e.g., design tables).

IModelDoc2::ReloadOrReplace re-attaches the detached file to the file system; however, any changes made to the detached file are not preserved unless you save the file to disk before calling IModelDoc2::ReloadOrReplace.

CAUTION:This method is intended to be used by PDM systems. Using this method incorrectly could corrupt your data.
