# InsertBreak3 Method (IView)

Inserts the specified type of break at the specified location in this drawing view.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function InsertBreak3( _
   ByVal Orientation As System.Integer, _
   ByVal Position1 As System.Double, _
   ByVal Position2 As System.Double, _
   ByVal Style As System.Integer, _
   ByVal ShapeIntensity As System.Integer, _
   ByVal BreakSketchBlocks As System.Boolean _
) As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IView
Dim Orientation As System.Integer
Dim Position1 As System.Double
Dim Position2 As System.Double
Dim Style As System.Integer
Dim ShapeIntensity As System.Integer
Dim BreakSketchBlocks As System.Boolean
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.InsertBreak3(Orientation, Position1, Position2, Style, ShapeIntensity, BreakSketchBlocks)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object InsertBreak3(
   System.int Orientation,
   System.double Position1,
   System.double Position2,
   System.int Style,
   System.int ShapeIntensity,
   System.bool BreakSketchBlocks
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ InsertBreak3(
   System.int Orientation,
   System.double Position1,
   System.double Position2,
   System.int Style,
   System.int ShapeIntensity,
   System.bool BreakSketchBlocks
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Orientation`: Horizontal or vertical cut as defined in[swBreakLineOrientation_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swBreakLineOrientation_e.html)
- `Position1`: Location of the first line in the break (seeRemarks)
- `Position2`: Location of the second line in the break (seeRemarks)
- `Style`: Break line style as defined in[swBreakLineStyle_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swBreakLineStyle_e.html)
- `ShapeIntensity`: Shape intensity for jagged cut break lines only; valid range is 1 (most) through 5 (least)
- `BreakSketchBlocks`: True to break sketch blocks, false to not

### Return Value

[Break line](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IBreakLine.html)

## VBA Syntax

See

[View::InsertBreak3](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~View~InsertBreak3.html)

## Remarks

A break in a drawing view consists of a pair of break lines. This method inserts the break lines at the locations indicated by Position1 and Position2.

| If the orientation of the break is... | Then Position1 and Position2 are... |
| --- | --- |
| Horizontal | Y values relative to the drawing view origin, indicating where along the Y axis to place the breaks |
| Vertical | X values relative to the drawing view origin, indicating where along the X axis to place the breaks |
