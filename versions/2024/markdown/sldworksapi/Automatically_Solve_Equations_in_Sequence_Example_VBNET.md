# Automatically Solve Equations in Sequence Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to automatically sequence the equations in an order
determined by SOLIDWORKS to produce accurate results.

```
'-----------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Verify that the specified part to open exists.
' 2. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Sets the equation's Automatic solve order option
'    to true, which results in the model's
'    independent equations executing before
'    dependent equations, if any.
' 2. Examine the Immediate window.
'
' NOTE: Because this model is used elsewhere,
' do save changes.
