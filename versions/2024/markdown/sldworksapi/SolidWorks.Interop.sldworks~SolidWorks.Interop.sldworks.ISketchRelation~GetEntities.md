## Remarks

When you create a sketch relation, an internal entity may also be created to define that sketch relation. For example, if you add a sketch relation by specifying or selecting a point and an edge, a sketch segment may be created. If this happens, then ISketchRelation::GetEntities and[ISketchRelation::IGetEntities](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchRelation~IGetEntities.html)return the point and sketch segment. To get the actual entities used to define the sketch relation, call[ISketchRelation::GetDefinitionEntities](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchRelation~GetDefinitionEntities.html)or[ISketchRelation::IGetDefinitionEntities](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchRelation~IGetDefinitionEntities.html).

Because some of the objects may be NULL, you should check for this before accessing them. You should deallocate any dynamically allocated memory.
