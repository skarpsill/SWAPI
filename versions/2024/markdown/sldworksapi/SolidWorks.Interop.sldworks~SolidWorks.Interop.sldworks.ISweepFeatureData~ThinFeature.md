## Remarks

To make a thin sweep, you must set this property before calling[IFeatureManager::CreateFeature](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~CreateFeature.html). You cannot make a thin-walled sweep feature after the sweep has been created, and you cannot edit a sweep feature to make it thin walled.

This property is not valid for swept-surface features.
