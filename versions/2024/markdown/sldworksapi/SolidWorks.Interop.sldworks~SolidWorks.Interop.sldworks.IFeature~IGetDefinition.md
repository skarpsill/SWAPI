# IGetDefinition Method (IFeature)

Gets the feature data object for a feature, such as an extrusion, loft, fillet, chamfer, etc., in order to access the parameters that control the definition of this feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetDefinition() As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeature
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.IGetDefinition()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object IGetDefinition()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ IGetDefinition();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

IUnknown interface to the feature data object; use QueryInterface to get the interface to the actual object (see**Remarks**)

## VBA Syntax

See

[Feature::IGetDefinition](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Feature~IGetDefinition.html)

.

## Remarks

You can use this method to query the feature data object, and you can modify the feature data object using[IFeature::IModifyDefinition2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~IModifyDefinition2.html). Set the feature data object to null when it is no longer needed. Not all feature types are supported, so check to see that the returned object is valid.

To:

- get the type of feature and the name of its associated interface, use

  [IFeature::GetTypeName](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetTypeName.html)

  or

  [IFeature::GetTypeName2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetTypeName2.html)

  .
- see a complete list of interfaces for feature data objects (e.g., interfaces ending in FeatureData or FeatureData2, such as IExtrudeFeatureData2, ILoftFeatureData, ISimpleFilletFeatureData2, IChamferFeatureData2, etc.), see the

  Features Interfaces

  section in

  [Functional Categories](FunctionalCategories-sldworksapi.html)

  .
- get the object of a feature that is not a feature data object, use

  [IFeature::GetSpecificFeature2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetSpecificFeature2.html)

  .
