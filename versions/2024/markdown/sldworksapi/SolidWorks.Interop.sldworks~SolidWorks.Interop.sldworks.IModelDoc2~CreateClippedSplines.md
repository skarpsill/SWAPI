# CreateClippedSplines Method (IModelDoc2)

Creates one or more sketch spline segments that are clipped against a given (x1, y1), (x2, y2) rectangle. This rectangle lies in the space of the active 2D sketch.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function CreateClippedSplines( _
   ByVal ParamsIn As System.Object, _
   ByVal X1 As System.Double, _
   ByVal Y1 As System.Double, _
   ByVal X2 As System.Double, _
   ByVal Y2 As System.Double _
) As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IModelDoc2
Dim ParamsIn As System.Object
Dim X1 As System.Double
Dim Y1 As System.Double
Dim X2 As System.Double
Dim Y2 As System.Double
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.CreateClippedSplines(ParamsIn, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object CreateClippedSplines(
   System.object ParamsIn,
   System.double X1,
   System.double Y1,
   System.double X2,
   System.double Y2
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ CreateClippedSplines(
   System.Object^ ParamsIn,
   System.double X1,
   System.double Y1,
   System.double X2,
   System.double Y2
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `ParamsIn`: SeeRemarks
- `X1`: x component of the lower corner of the clipping rectangle
- `Y1`: y component of the lower corner of the clipping rectangle
- `X2`: x component of the upper corner of the clipping rectangle
- `Y2`: y component of the upper corner of the clipping rectangle

### Return Value

Array of newly created sketch segments

## VBA Syntax

See

[ModelDoc2::CreateClippedSplines](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~ModelDoc2~CreateClippedSplines.html)

.

## Remarks

The rectangle lies in the space of the active 2D sketch. The results are undefined for calls made in an active 3D sketch.

The ParamsIn argument in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is a SafeArray of size (4 + numKnots + numControlPointDoubles) as follows:

[Dimension, Order, NumControlPoints, Periodicity, knot1, knot2,..., ControlPoint1[Dimension], ControlPoint2[Dimension],...]

where:

Dimension,Order,NumControlPoints, andPeriodicityare integer values.

The size of the knot array is determined by (NumControlPoints+Order).

The size of the control point array is based upon the curve dimension:

- IfDimension= 3, thenControlPointis an array of 3 doubles ( x, y, z ).
- IfDimension= 4, thenControlPointis an array of 4 doubles ( x, y, z, w ) where w = weight.
