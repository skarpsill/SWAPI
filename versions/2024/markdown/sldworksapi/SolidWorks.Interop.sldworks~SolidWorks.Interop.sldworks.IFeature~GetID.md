## Remarks

A feature ID:

- is unique within the document.
- is persistent across SOLIDWORKS sessions and never changes, even if you

  [change the name of the feature](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~Name.html)

  .
- can be used to identify a specific feature when multiple features exist in a model.
- cannot be assigned by users.
- is not the same as a

  [persistent reference ID](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/overview/Persistent_Reference_IDs.htm)

  . You can get a feature using its persistent reference ID, but you cannot get a feature using this method.
