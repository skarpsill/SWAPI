## Remarks

This property corresponds to a Type in the Thread PropertyManager.

Types are defined in***.sldlfp**files. You can specify this property with or without the sldlfp extension and path. If you specify this property without:

- a path, SOLIDWORKS searches for the file in the folder specified by

  Tools > Options > System Options > File Locations > Show folders for Thread Profiles

  .
- an extension, SOLIDWORKS assumes the extension is sldlfp.
