## Remarks

The image type and resolution can be controlled interactively under TIFF export options.

If TIFF export is set to screen, then the output from this method is based on the current screen resolution. If it's set to print, then the output is based on the DPI specified in the TIFF options dialog.

The memory for the image bits (DIBSECTION.dsBm.bmBits) and this structure are allocated by the SOLIDWORKS application and must be deleted by the caller. For more information, see the description of Bitmap structures and DIBSECTION in Microsoft Help.

**NOTE:**This method is only available through early binding and with 64-bit versions of the SOLIDWORKS software.
