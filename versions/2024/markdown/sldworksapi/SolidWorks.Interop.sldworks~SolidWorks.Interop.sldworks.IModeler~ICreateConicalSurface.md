# ICreateConicalSurface Method (IModeler)

Obsolete. Superseded by

[IModeler::ICreateConicalSurface2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModeler~ICreateCylindricalSurface2.html)

.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function ICreateConicalSurface( _
   ByRef Center As System.Double, _
   ByRef Direction As System.Double, _
   ByVal Radius As System.Double, _
   ByVal SemiAngle As System.Double _
) As Surface
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IModeler
Dim Center As System.Double
Dim Direction As System.Double
Dim Radius As System.Double
Dim SemiAngle As System.Double
Dim value As Surface

value = instance.ICreateConicalSurface(Center, Direction, Radius, SemiAngle)
```

### C#

```csharp
Surface ICreateConicalSurface(
   ref System.double Center,
   ref System.double Direction,
   System.double Radius,
   System.double SemiAngle
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Surface^ ICreateConicalSurface(
   System.double% Center,
   System.double% Direction,
   System.double Radius,
   System.double SemiAngle
)
```
