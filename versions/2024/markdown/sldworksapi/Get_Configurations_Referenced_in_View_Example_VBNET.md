# Get Configurations Referenced in View Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to get the names and persistent reference IDs of the configurations referenced
in each drawing view in the first drawing sheet.

```
'---------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open a drawing document with multiple
'    drawing views and multiple referenced
'    configurations in the first drawing sheet
'    in the drawing.
' 2. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Traverses the drawing views in the first
'    drawing sheet and gets each drawing view's:
'    *  name
'    *  referenced model name
'    *  referenced configuration name and
'       persistent reference ID
' 2. Examine the Immediate window.
