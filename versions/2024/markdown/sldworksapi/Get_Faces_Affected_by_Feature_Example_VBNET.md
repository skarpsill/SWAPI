# Get Faces Affected by Feature Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to get the faces affected by a feature. This
example also highlights the edges on each affected face in blue.

```vb
 '-------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
 ' 1. Open a model document.
 ' 2. Select a feature, such as a draft, that affects faces.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1. Highlights the edges of the faces in blue that are affected
 '    by the selected feature.
 ' 2. Examine the graphics area.
