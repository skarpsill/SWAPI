| --- | --- | --- |
| Three | Regular Suppressed Highlighted | Windows bitmap ( *.bmp ) format 16 pixels wide X 18 pixels high |
| Nine NOTES: This size array is only valid for macro features created in parts, assemblies, and drawings in SOLIDWORKS 2017 and later. SOLIDWORKS displays the appropriate images based on the current DPI setting of the display device. | Regular small Suppressed small Highlighted small Regular medium Suppressed medium Highlighted medium Regular large Suppressed large Highlighted large | Windows bitmap ( *.bmp ) format Recommended sizes are: Small: 20 pixels wide X 20 pixels high Medium: 32 pixels wide X 32 pixels high Large: 40 pixels wide X 40 pixels high |

You can specify either the full path name or just the file name for the strings; for example,c:\bitmaps\icon1.bmporicon1.bmp.

If you change the bitmaps after inserting them with a macro feature into a SOLIDWORKS document, then the new bitmaps are not displayed until you exit and restart SOLIDWORKS.
