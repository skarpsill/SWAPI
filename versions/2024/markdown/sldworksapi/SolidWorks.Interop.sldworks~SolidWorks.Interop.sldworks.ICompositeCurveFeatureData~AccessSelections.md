# AccessSelections Method (ICompositeCurveFeatureData)

Gains access to the selections that define this composite curve.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function AccessSelections( _
   ByVal TopDoc As ModelDoc2, _
   ByVal Component As Component2 _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICompositeCurveFeatureData
Dim TopDoc As ModelDoc2
Dim Component As Component2
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.AccessSelections(TopDoc, Component)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool AccessSelections(
   ModelDoc2 TopDoc,
   Component2 Component
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool AccessSelections(
   ModelDoc2^ TopDoc,
   Component2^ Component
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `TopDoc`: Top-level document
- `Component`: Component in which the feature is to be modified

### Return Value

True if the selections are successfully accessed, false if not

## Remarks

| To modify a feature in a... | Then... |
| --- | --- |
| Part | TopDoc argument is the IModelDoc2 for the part Component argument is NULL |
| Assembly | TopDoc is the IModelDoc2 object for the assembly Component argument is the IComponent2 object in which the feature is to be modified |

This method puts the model into a rollback state to allow access to the selections that define this feature. You must use either of the following methods to restore the rollback state:

- [IFeature::ModifyDefinition](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html)

  and

  [IFeature::IModifyDefinition2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~IModifyDefinition2.html)

  if you modified the feature
