Dim instance As IPrimaryMemberRefPlaneFeatureData
Dim RetEntities As System.Object
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.SetReferenceLocations(RetEntities)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool SetReferenceLocations(
   System.object RetEntities
)

### Return Value

True if location references successfully set, false if not

## VBA Syntax

See

[PrimaryMemberRefPlaneFeatureData::SetReferenceLocations](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~PrimaryMemberRefPlaneFeatureData~SetReferenceLocations.html)

.

## Examples

See the

[IPrimaryMemberRefPlaneFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IPrimaryMemberRefPlaneFeatureData.html)

examples.

## Remarks

The number of members created = ([IPrimaryMemberRefPlaneFeatureData::GetReferenceAxes](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IPrimaryMemberRefPlaneFeatureData~GetReferenceAxes.html)*[IPrimaryMemberRefPlaneFeatureData::GetReferenceLocations](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IPrimaryMemberRefPlaneFeatureData~GetReferenceLocations.html))

During:

- creation, you can set any number of entities that are intersecting with the start and end references and at least one reference axis entity.
- editing, you can set only one entity that is intersecting with the start and end refereces and one reference axis entity.
