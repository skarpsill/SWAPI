# GetPhysicalSimulationComponents Method (IAssemblyDoc)

Obsolete. Not superseded.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub GetPhysicalSimulationComponents( _
   ByVal InDuration As System.Double, _
   ByRef OutCount As System.Integer, _
   ByRef OutComponents As System.Object, _
   ByRef OutTransforms As System.Object, _
   ByRef OutStepStartTimes As System.Object, _
   ByRef OutStepDurations As System.Object, _
   ByRef OutTotalPhysSimDuration As System.Double _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IAssemblyDoc
Dim InDuration As System.Double
Dim OutCount As System.Integer
Dim OutComponents As System.Object
Dim OutTransforms As System.Object
Dim OutStepStartTimes As System.Object
Dim OutStepDurations As System.Object
Dim OutTotalPhysSimDuration As System.Double

instance.GetPhysicalSimulationComponents(InDuration, OutCount, OutComponents, OutTransforms, OutStepStartTimes, OutStepDurations, OutTotalPhysSimDuration)
```

### C#

```csharp
void GetPhysicalSimulationComponents(
   System.double InDuration,
   out System.int OutCount,
   out System.object OutComponents,
   out System.object OutTransforms,
   out System.object OutStepStartTimes,
   out System.object OutStepDurations,
   out System.double OutTotalPhysSimDuration
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void GetPhysicalSimulationComponents(
   System.double InDuration,
   [Out] System.int OutCount,
   [Out] System.Object^ OutComponents,
   [Out] System.Object^ OutTransforms,
   [Out] System.Object^ OutStepStartTimes,
   [Out] System.Object^ OutStepDurations,
   [Out] System.double OutTotalPhysSimDuration
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `InDuration`: Total elapsed time for Physical Simulation
- `OutCount`: Size for all returned arrays
- `OutComponents`: Array of the

objects
- `OutTransforms`: Array of the

[IMathTransform](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IMathTransform.html)

objects
- `OutStepStartTimes`: Array of doubles of size outCount; when each step in the Physical Simulation should happen
- `OutStepDurations`: Array of doubles of size outCount; how long each step in the Physical Simulation should take
- `OutTotalPhysSimDuration`: Total elapsed time Physical Simulation should have taken
