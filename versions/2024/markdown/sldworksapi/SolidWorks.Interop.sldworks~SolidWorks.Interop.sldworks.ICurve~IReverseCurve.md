Dim instance As ICurve
Dim value As Curve

value = instance.IReverseCurve()
```

### C#

```csharp
Curve IReverseCurve()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Curve^ IReverseCurve();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

Pointer to the reversed[curve](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ICurve.html)

## VBA Syntax

See

[Curve::IReverseCurve](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Curve~IReverseCurve.html)
