# Group and Ungroup Components Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to:

- group the same components in
  the same configuration in an assembly into a folder in the FeatureManager design tree.
- ungroup the grouped
  components.

```
'---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open public_documents\samples\tutorial\advdrawings\98food processor.sldasm.
' 2. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Groups the rubber feet components into rubber feet(Default)(5).
' 2. Examine the Immediate window and FeatureManager design tree.
' 3. Press F5.
' 4. Ungroups rubber feet(Default)(5).
' 5. Examine the Immediate window and FeatureManager design tree.
'
' NOTE: Because the assembly is used elsewhere, do not save changes.
