# MakeSketchBlockFromSketch Method (ISketchManager)

Creates a block definition at the specified location using all of the sketch entities in the active sketch.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function MakeSketchBlockFromSketch( _
   ByVal InsertionPoint As MathPoint, _
   ByVal Sketch As Sketch _
) As SketchBlockDefinition
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISketchManager
Dim InsertionPoint As MathPoint
Dim Sketch As Sketch
Dim value As SketchBlockDefinition

value = instance.MakeSketchBlockFromSketch(InsertionPoint, Sketch)
```

### C#

```csharp
SketchBlockDefinition MakeSketchBlockFromSketch(
   MathPoint InsertionPoint,
   Sketch Sketch
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
SketchBlockDefinition^ MakeSketchBlockFromSketch(
   MathPoint^ InsertionPoint,
   Sketch^ Sketch
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `InsertionPoint`: [Insertion point](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IMathPoint.html)

, which is a 2D point with z = 0.0, for the block definition
- `Sketch`: [Sketch](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketch.html)

to use

### Return Value

[Block definition](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchBlockDefinition.html)
