# InsertMoldCoreCavitySolids Method (IFeatureManager)

Creates a core/cavity solid feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function InsertMoldCoreCavitySolids( _
   ByVal Dist1 As System.Double, _
   ByVal Dist2 As System.Double, _
   ByVal Setback As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal Angle As System.Double _
) As Feature
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeatureManager
Dim Dist1 As System.Double
Dim Dist2 As System.Double
Dim Setback As System.Boolean
Dim Angle As System.Double
Dim value As Feature

value = instance.InsertMoldCoreCavitySolids(Dist1, Dist2, Setback, Angle)
```

### C#

```csharp
Feature InsertMoldCoreCavitySolids(
   System.double Dist1,
   System.double Dist2,
   System.bool Setback,
   System.double Angle
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Feature^ InsertMoldCoreCavitySolids(
   System.double Dist1,
   System.double Dist2,
   System.bool Setback,
   System.double Angle
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Dist1`: Length of the extrusion in Direction 1
- `Dist2`: Length of the extrusion in Direction 2ParamDesc
- `Setback`: True to enable setback surface, false to notParamDesc
- `Angle`: Draft angle for the setback surfaceParamDesc

### Return Value

Pointer to the

[IFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature.html)

object

## VBA Syntax

See

[FeatureManager::InsertMoldCoreCavitySolids](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~FeatureManager~InsertMoldCoreCavitySolids.html)

.

## Remarks

To use this method:

- The Parting Line feature must exist.
- The parting surface must be generated.
- The part must be separated into core and cavity (sheet bodies).
- A sketch describing the outline of the mold block must exist. The sketch must be perpendicular to the pull direction. Usually, the sketch is a rectangle that includes the part (core and cavity).

The location of the sketch plane specifies the parting plane in the setback surface option.

- Without the setback surface option, the parting surface must extend beyond the block sketch so that the parting surface is cut off by the block.
- With the setback surface option, the parting surface should be included within the block sketch. The parting plane (sketch plane) cannot intersect with the parting surface. Therefore, the parting plane must be either higher or lower than the parting surface. From the parting surface, a set of ruled surfaces is generated to be trimmed by the parting plane.
