# GetLoopCount Method (IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData)

Gets the number of closed loops for all of the patches.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetLoopCount() As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData
Dim value As System.Integer

value = instance.GetLoopCount()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int GetLoopCount()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.int GetLoopCount();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

Number of loops for the patches

## VBA Syntax

See

[ShutOffSurfaceFeatureData::GetLoopCount](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~ShutOffSurfaceFeatureData~GetLoopCount.html)

.

## Examples

See

[IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData.html)

examples.

## Remarks

Call this method before calling

[IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData::IGetEdges](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData~IGetEdges.html)

to get the size of the array for that method.
