# DeSelect Method (IAnnotation)

Deselects this annotation.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function DeSelect() As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IAnnotation
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.DeSelect()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool DeSelect()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool DeSelect();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

True if the feature object was successfully deselected, false otherwise

## VBA Syntax

See

[Annotation::DeSelect](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Annotation~DeSelect.html)

.

## Remarks

Use

[IModelDoc2::DeSelectByID](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~DeSelectByID.html)

instead of using this method. This method does not work

well when a PropertyManager page is open or a command is running. IModelDoc2::DeSelectByID

handles selection correctly whether or not a command is running.
