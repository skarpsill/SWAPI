# Insert Swept-cut Feature With Bidirectional Twist Example (VBA)

This example shows how to create a swept-cut feature with a bidirectional
twist.

```vb
 '-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions: Verify that the specified part exists.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1. Inserts a reference plane and circle sketch at a midpoint on
 '    the sweep path of the model.
 ' 2. Creates a swept-cut feature with a bidirectional twist.
 ' 3. Examine the FeatureManager design tree and graphics area.
 '
 ' Note: Because the model is used elsewhere, do not save changes.
