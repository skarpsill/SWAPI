# IGetCThreads Method (IView)

Gets all of the cosmetic threads on this drawing view.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetCThreads( _
   ByVal NumCThread As System.Integer _
) As CThread
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IView
Dim NumCThread As System.Integer
Dim value As CThread

value = instance.IGetCThreads(NumCThread)
```

### C#

```csharp
CThread IGetCThreads(
   System.int NumCThread
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
CThread^ IGetCThreads(
   System.int NumCThread
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `NumCThread`: Total number of cosmetic threads on the drawing view

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of

  [cosmetic threads](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ICThread.html)
- VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

## Remarks

Use this method to obtain the array of cosmetic threads all at once instead of calling[IView::GetFirstCThread](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IView~GetFirstCThread.html)and then repeatedly calling[ICThread::GetNext](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ICThread~GetNext.html)to obtain the remaining cosmetic threads on the drawing view.

Before calling this method, call[IView::GetCThreadCount](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IView~GetCThreadCount.html)to get the value for numCThread.
