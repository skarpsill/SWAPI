) As SketchRelation
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

Dim Filter As System.Integer
Dim Count As System.Integer
Dim value As SketchRelation

value = instance.IGetRelations(Filter, Count)
```

   System.int Filter,
   System.int Count
)
```

### C++/CLI

)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Filter`: Sketch relation as defined in[swSketchRelationFilterType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swSketchRelationFilterType_e.html)
- `Count`: Number of sketch relations

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of

  [sketch relations](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchRelation.html)

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

## Remarks

Because some of the objects may be NULL, you should check for this before accessing them. You should deallocate on any dynamically allocated memory.

Call[ISketchRelationManager::GetRelationsCount](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchRelationManager~GetRelationsCount.html)before calling this method to get the value for Count.
