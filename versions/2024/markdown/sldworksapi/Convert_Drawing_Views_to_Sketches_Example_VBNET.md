# Convert Drawing Views to Sketch Blocks Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to convert drawing views to sketches and sketch
blocks.

```vb
'----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions: Open public_documents\samples\tutorial\api\ReplaceView.slddrw
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1. Converts Drawing View1 to a sketch.
 ' 2. Converts Drawing View2 to a sketch block
 ' 3. Converts Drawing View3 to a sketch block at a new position in the drawing.
 '
 ' NOTE: Because the model is used elsewhere, do not save changes.
