# PathAlignmentType Property (ISweepFeatureData)

Gets or sets the alignment of the sweep path in this sweep feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property PathAlignmentType As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISweepFeatureData
Dim value As System.Integer

instance.PathAlignmentType = value

value = instance.PathAlignmentType
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int PathAlignmentType {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.int PathAlignmentType {
   System.int get();
   void set (    System.int value);
}
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Property Value

Sweep path alignment as defined in[swTangencyType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swTangencyType_e.html):

- swTangencyAllFaces
- swTangencyDirectionVector
- swTangencyNone

## VBA Syntax
