    Dim Filter As String
    Dim fileName As String
    Dim fileConfig As String
    Dim fileDispName As String
    Dim fileDisplayState As String
    Dim fileOptions As Long
```

```
    Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
    ' The Filter string has three filters
    ' associated with it; note the use of
    ' the | character between filters
    Filter = "SOLIDWORKS Files (*.sldprt; *.sldasm; *.slddrw)|*.sldprt;*.sldasm;*.slddrw|Filter name (*.fil)|*.fil|All Files (*.*)|*.*|"
    fileName = swApp.GetOpenFileName2("File to Attach", "", Filter, fileOptions, fileConfig, fileDispName, fileDisplayState)
