# Change Visibility of Sketch Block Instances (VB.NET)

This example shows how to hide and show
sketch block instances in a drawing document.

'------------------------------------------------- ' Preconditions: ' 1. Drawing document containing a sketch ' block with one or more sketch block instances is open. ' 2. The sketch block is selected in the FeatureManager design tree. ' ' Postconditions: All sketch block instances are hidden if visible, or ' shown if hidden. '------------------------------------------------- Imports SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks Imports SolidWorks.Interop.swconst Imports System Imports System.Diagnostics Partial Class SolidWorksMacro Sub Main() Dim swModelDoc As ModelDoc2 Dim swSelMgr As SelectionMgr Dim swFeature As Feature Dim swBlockDefinition As SketchBlockDefinition Dim blocks As Object Dim i As Integer swModelDoc = swApp. ActiveDoc swSelMgr = swModelDoc. SelectionManager ' Select block is selected in FeatureManager
design tree swFeature = swSelMgr. GetSelectedObject6 (1,
-1) If swFeature Is Nothing Then MsgBox( "Select
a sketch block in the FeatureManager design tree, then rerun the macro." ) Else swBlockDefinition = swFeature. GetSpecificFeature2 Debug.Print( "Feature type : " & swFeature. GetTypeName2 ) If Not (swBlockDefinition Is Nothing ) Then blocks = swBlockDefinition. GetInstances For i =
LBound(blocks) To UBound(blocks) Dim swBlockInstance As SketchBlockInstance swBlockInstance = blocks(i) Debug.Print( "Sketch block
instance: " & (i + 1)) Debug.Print( " Angle : " & swBlockInstance. Angle ) Debug.Print( " Scale : " & swBlockInstance. Scale2 ) ' Hide or show the sketch block
