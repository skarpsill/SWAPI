    Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks
    Dim swModel As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
    Dim nRetVal As Long
```

```
    Set swApp = CreateObject("SldWorks.Application")
    Set swModel = swApp.ActiveDoc
```

```
    ' Fails for drawings because functionality is not supported in user interface
    nRetVal = swModel.Extension.ReloadOrReplace(False, swModel.GetPathName, True, True)
```

```
    Debug.Print "File = " & swModel.GetPathName
    Debug.Print "  ReloadOrReplace (0 = swComponentReloadError_e.swReloadOkay) = " & nRetVal
