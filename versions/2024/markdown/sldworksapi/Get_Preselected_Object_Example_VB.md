# Get Preselected Object Example (VBA)

This example shows how to get a preselected object when a preselection
event is fired.

```
'-----------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open a part, assembly, or drawing.
' 2. In the SOLIDWORKS Visual Basic IDE:
'    a. Copy and paste Main into the macro's main module.
'    b. Click Insert > Class Module and copy and paste
'       Class1 into that module.
'    c. Click Insert > Class Module and copy and paste
'       Class2 into that module.
'    d. Click Insert > Class Module and copy and paste
'       Class3 into that module.
' 3. If a part or assembly document is active, then
'    preselect (mouse over) a face.
'    - or -
'    If a drawing document is active, then preselect
'    an edge.
' 4. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. When a face is preselected in a part or assembly
'    document, or an edge is preselected in a drawing document,
'    then that interface's UserSelectionPreNotify event is fired.
' 2. In the SOLIDWORKS Visual Basic IDE, click Run > Reset to
'    stop running the macro.
' 3. Examine the Immediate window.
