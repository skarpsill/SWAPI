# ConstrainAll Method (ISketch)

Attempts to solve all of the apparent relations in the sketch and returns the number

of constraints that were added to the sketch.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function ConstrainAll() As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISketch
Dim value As System.Integer

value = instance.ConstrainAll()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int ConstrainAll()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.int ConstrainAll();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

Number of constraints added

## VBA Syntax

See

[Sketch::ConstrainAll](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Sketch~ConstrainAll.html)

.

## Remarks

f the sketch already has constraints, then no constraints are added (in the same

way that the user-interface button

Constrain All

can only be pressed once for a sketch.)
