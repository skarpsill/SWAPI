# ProjectionType Property (IRefPlaneFeatureData)

Gets or sets the projection type for this on-surface reference plane feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property ProjectionType As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IRefPlaneFeatureData
Dim value As System.Integer

instance.ProjectionType = value

value = instance.ProjectionType
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int ProjectionType {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.int ProjectionType {
   System.int get();
   void set (    System.int value);
}
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Property Value

Type of a plane on a surface as defined in

[swOnSurfacePlaneProjectType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swOnSurfacePlaneProjectType_e.html)

## VBA Syntax

See

[RefPlaneFeatureData::ProjectionType](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~RefPlaneFeatureData~ProjectionType.html)

.

## Remarks

IMPORTANT:

Reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2010 or later are constraint based; reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2009 or earlier are not. See the

Remarks

section in the

[IRefPlaneFeatureData interface](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IRefPlaneFeatureData.html)

topic for details about reference planes and this interface.
