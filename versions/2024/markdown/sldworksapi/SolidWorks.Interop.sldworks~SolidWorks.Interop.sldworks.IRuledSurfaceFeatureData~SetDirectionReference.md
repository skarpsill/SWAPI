# SetDirectionReference Method (IRuledSurfaceFeatureData)

Sets the direction of the extrusion for this ruled-surface feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub SetDirectionReference( _
   ByVal Ref1 As System.Object, _
   ByVal Ref2 As System.Object _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IRuledSurfaceFeatureData
Dim Ref1 As System.Object
Dim Ref2 As System.Object

instance.SetDirectionReference(Ref1, Ref2)
```

### C#

```csharp
void SetDirectionReference(
   System.object Ref1,
   System.object Ref2
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void SetDirectionReference(
   System.Object^ Ref1,
   System.Object^ Ref2
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Ref1`: First reference entity (see

Remarks

)
- `Ref2`: Second reference entity (see

Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

See

[RuledSurfaceFeatureData::SetDirectionReference](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~RuledSurfaceFeatureData~SetDirectionReference.html)

.

## Remarks

Sometimes one reference entity can sufficiently define a direction; for example, an edge or axis. Other times, two reference entities are required to define a direction; for example, two vertices or two sketch points.

(Table)=========================================================

| If... | Then... |
| --- | --- |
| One reference entity can sufficiently define the direction | Ref2 is NULL |
| Two reference entities are required to define the direction | Both Ref1 and Ref2 are non-NULL |

Valid reference entities for type1 and type2:

- line segment
- edge
- axis
- vertex
- face
- plane
- sketch point
