# Get and Set FeatureManager Design Tree Display (VBA)

This example shows how to get and set properties related to displaying
the FeatureManager design tree.

```
'----------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Verify that the specified document exists.
' 2. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Opens the assembly and gets the FeatureManager
'    design tree's display-related property values.
' 2. Examine both the Immediate window and the FeatureManager
'    design tree, then press F5.
' 3. Re-examine both the Immediate window the
'    FeatureManager design tree to verify the changes.
'
' NOTE: Because this assembly document is used
' elsewhere, do not save changes.
