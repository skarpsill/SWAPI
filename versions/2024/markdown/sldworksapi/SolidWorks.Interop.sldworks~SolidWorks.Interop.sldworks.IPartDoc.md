# IPartDoc Interface

Provides access to functions that perform operations on parts in part documents.

**NOTE:**Click the**Members**link, located near the top of the topic, to see this interface's methods and properties.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Public Interface IPartDoc
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

Dim instance As IPartDoc
```

### C#

public interface IPartDoc
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
public interface class IPartDoc
```

## VBA Syntax

## Remarks

This interface provides functions that allow you to:

- create bodies and features.
- perform suppress operations.
- obtain part extents and tessellation.
- locate entities by name.

The SOLIDWORKS API also has functions that are common to all document types. For example, determining the file name associated with a document would be a common operation. To expose common document-level functions, the SOLIDWORKS API uses the[IModelDoc2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2.html)object.

Events are implemented with delegates in the Microsoft .NET Framework. See the[Overview](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks_namespace.html)topic for a list of delegates for this interface.
