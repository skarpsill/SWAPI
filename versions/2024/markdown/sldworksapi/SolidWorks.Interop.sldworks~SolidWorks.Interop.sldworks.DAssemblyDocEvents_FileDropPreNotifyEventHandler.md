# DAssemblyDocEvents_FileDropPreNotifyEventHandler Delegate (SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks)

Pre-notifies user applications before a part is dropped from File Explorer into an assembly document.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Public Delegate Function DAssemblyDocEvents_FileDropPreNotifyEventHandler( _
   ByVal FileName As System.String _
) As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As New DAssemblyDocEvents_FileDropPreNotifyEventHandler(AddressOf HandlerMethod)
```

### C#

```csharp
public delegate System.int DAssemblyDocEvents_FileDropPreNotifyEventHandler(
   System.string FileName
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
public delegate System.int DAssemblyDocEvents_FileDropPreNotifyEventHandler(
   System.String^ FileName
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `FileName`: Name of the file to use for the rest of the drop process

## VBA Syntax

See

[FleDropPreNotify Event (AssemblyDoc)](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/SldWorks~AssemblyDoc~FileDropPreNotify_EV.html)

.

## Remarks

If developing a C++ application, use[swAssemblyFileDropPreNotify](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swAssemblyNotify_e.html)to register for this notification.

SOLIDWORKS passes the file name of the dropped part into the event handler. The event handler can use[IAssemblyDoc::SetDroppedFileName](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IAssemblyDoc~SetDroppedFileName.html)to replace this document with a temporary document. For example, this is useful when the file being dropped is managed by a project data management (PDM) system or otherwise not accessible directly by SOLIDWORKS. Your application (the PDM system in this example) is responsible for ensuring that the files and references are properly updated.
