.

## VBA Syntax

See

[Comment::Name](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Comment~Name.html)

.

## Examples

[Get Comments in Comments Folder (C#)](Get_Comments_in_Comments_Folder_Example_CSharp.htm)

[Get Comments in Comments Folder (VB.NET)](Get_Comments_in_Comments_Folder_Example_VBNET.htm)

[Get Comments in Comments Folder (VBA)](Get_Comments_in_Comments_Folder_Example_VB.htm)

## Remarks

You cannot set this property if the comment is owned by a feature because the name of the comment always matches the name of the feature that owns it. To determine if a comment is owned by a feature, use[IComment::FeatureOwner](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IComment~FeatureOwner.html).

You must rebuild the FeatureManager design tree after setting the name of a comment. Use[IFeatureManager::UpdateFeatureTree](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~UpdateFeatureTree.html)to perform this action.
