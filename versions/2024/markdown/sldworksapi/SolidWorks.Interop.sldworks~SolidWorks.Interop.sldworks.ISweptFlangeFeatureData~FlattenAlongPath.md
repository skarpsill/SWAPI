# FlattenAlongPath Property (ISweptFlangeFeatureData)

Gets or sets whether to flatten the flange profile along the sweep path of this swept flange feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property FlattenAlongPath As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISweptFlangeFeatureData
Dim value As System.Boolean

instance.FlattenAlongPath = value

value = instance.FlattenAlongPath
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool FlattenAlongPath {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.bool FlattenAlongPath {
   System.bool get();
   void set (    System.bool value);
}
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Property Value

True to flatten the profile along the sweep path, false to not

## VBA Syntax

See

[SweptFlangeFeatureData::FlattenAlongPath](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~SweptFlangeFeatureData~FlattenAlongPath.html)

.

## Examples

See the

[ISweptFlangeFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISweptFlangeFeatureData.html)

examples.

## Remarks

This property is valid only when not creating the swept flange on an existing sheet metal feature.

If this property is true, then you can also specify[ISweptFlangeFeatureData::MaterialInside](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISweptFlangeFeatureData~MaterialInside.html).

If this property is:

- True, then when the model is flattened the

  [profile](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISweptFlangeFeatureData~Profile.html)

  flattens and is rotated parallel to the plane of the path. The

  [path](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISweptFlangeFeatureData~Path.html)

  is not flattened, and the result is a the shape of the path.
- False, then when the model is flattened the profile flattens and is rotated perpendicular to the plane of the path. The path is flattened, and the result is a rectangular shape.
