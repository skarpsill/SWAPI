### Parameters

- `BitMapFile`: Bitmap file that you want to use for the tab
- `ToolTip`: Text for the ToolTip

.

## Remarks

This method provides the ability to place your newly created Feature Manager tab on either the top or bottom pane. The pane may or may not be visible. However, the tab is added to the specified pane.

Under certain conditions, for example while theSurface, Extendcommand is active in the user interface, SOLIDWORKS locks the bottom pane and does not allow the activation of any other tab. If your application needs the ability to activate your new tab at all times, consider adding it either to the top pane or to both panes. If you add it to the top pane only, it may not be apparent to the user until the top pane is made visible.

If you receive a non-NULL return value, you can use[IFeatMgrView::GetFeatMgrViewWnd](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeatMgrView~GetFeatMgrViewWnd.html)or[IFeatureMgrView::GetFeatMgrViewWndx64](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeatMgrView~GetFeatMgrViewWndx64.html)to get the new view handle. Because the view created is empty, you can use the new view handle in combination with standard MFC calls to draw, as desired, into the view.

The FeatureManager design tree view added to this document is not persistent. In other words, the FeatureManager design tree view is not stored with this document and must be recreated upon reloading the document.

This method automatically sets up to receive FeatMgrView[ActivateNotify](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.DFeatMgrViewEvents_ActivateNotifyEventHandler.html)and[DeactivateNotify](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.DFeatMgrViewEvents_DeactivateNotifyEventHandler.html)events. On the appropriate notification, you can call[IModelDoc2::DeleteFeatureMgrView](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~DeleteFeatureMgrView.html)or[IModelDocExtension::DeleteFeatureMgrViewx64](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~DeleteFeatureMgrViewx64.html)to clean up and delete your view.
