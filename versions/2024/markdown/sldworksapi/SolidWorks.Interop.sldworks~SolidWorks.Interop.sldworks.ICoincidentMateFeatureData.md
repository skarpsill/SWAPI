.

## Examples

[Create Standard Mates (C#)](Create_Standard_Mates_Example_CSharp.htm)

## Remarks

A coincident mate:

- Positions the selected faces, edges, and planes so they share the same infinite plane.
- Positions two vertices so they touch.

[IMateFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IMateFeatureData.html)is the parent of this mate interface.

To create a coincident mate:

1. Follow general instructions in the

  [IAssemblyDoc::CreateMate](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IAssemblyDoc~CreateMate.html)

  Remarks.
2. Specify

  [ICoincidentMateFeatureData::EntitiesToMate](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ICoincidentMateFeatureData~EntitiesToMate.html)

  or use

  [IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~SelectByID2.html)

  to pre-select the entities to mate using Mark = 1.
3. Specify other properties of the CoincidentMateFeatureData object.

To edit a coincident mate:

1. Access its feature and call

  [IFeature::GetDefinition](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetDefinition.html)

  to get the MateFeatureData object.
2. Cast the MateFeatureData object to a CoincidentMateFeatureData object.
3. You cannot change the entities to mate by pre-selection. You must use ICoincidentMateFeatureData::EntitiesToMate to modify them.
4. Modify other properties of the CoincidentMateFeatureData object.
5. Call

  [IFeature::ModifyDefinition](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html)

  .

To delete this coincident mate, use[IModelDocExtension::DeleteSelection2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~DeleteSelection2.html).
