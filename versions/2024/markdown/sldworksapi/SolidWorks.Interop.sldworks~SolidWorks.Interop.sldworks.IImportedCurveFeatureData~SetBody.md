```

### C#

```csharp
void SetBody(
   Body2 DispBody
)
```

### C++/CLI

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `DispBody`: Wire[body](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IBody2.html)

## VBA Syntax

See

.

## Remarks

Wire bodies contain wires, loops, coedges, edges, and vertices. Wires typically represent profiles, construction lines, and center lines of swept shapes. Wires can also represent wire frames that, when surfaced, form shells.

The following methods create wire bodies:

- [IEdge::CreateWireBody](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IEdge~CreateWireBody.html)
- [ICurve::CreateWireBody](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ICurve~CreateWireBody.html)
- [IModeler::CreateWireBody](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModeler~CreateWireBody.html)

See[Accessing Selections that Define Features](sldworksAPIProgGuide.chm::/Miscellaneous/Accessing_Selections_that_Define_Features.htm)for additional details on using this method.
