# Roll Back Model Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to step through the FeatureManager design tree
of a model by rolling back to each feature in reverse sequence. Running
an example like this can provide insight into the design intent of the
user.

```
'-----------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open a part or assembly document.
' 2. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Observe the FeatureManager design tree
'    while the macro executes.
' 2. Examine the Immediate window to see the
'    names of the features rolled back and forward.
'
' NOTE: The delay between steps is set to 1 second.
'-----------------------------------
```
