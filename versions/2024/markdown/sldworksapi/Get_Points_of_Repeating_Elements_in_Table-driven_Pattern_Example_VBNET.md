# Get Points of Repeating Elements in Table-driven Pattern (VB.NET)

This example shows that the points that describe the locations of the
repeating elements in a table-driven pattern are based on the table-driven pattern's
coordinate system.

```
'---------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Verify that the part to open exists.
' 2. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Gets the coordinates of the
'    points for the two repeating elements in the
'    table-driven pattern.
' 2. Examine the Immediate window.
'
' NOTE: Because the part is used elsewhere, do
' not save changes.
