# EntitiesToMate Property (IConcentricMateFeatureData)

Gets or sets the entities to mate in this concentric mate.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property EntitiesToMate As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IConcentricMateFeatureData
Dim value As System.Object

instance.EntitiesToMate = value

value = instance.EntitiesToMate
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object EntitiesToMate {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Property Value

Entities to mate (see

Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

See

[ConcentricMateFeatureData::EntitiesToMate](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~ConcentricMateFeatureData~EntitiesToMate.html)

.

## Examples

See the

[IConcentricMateFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IConcentricMateFeatureData.html)

example.

## Remarks

You can create concentric mates with the following mate entity combinations:

| Mate entity/Mate entity | IEdge (arc, circular edge) | IRefAxis , (cone) | IRefAxis, (cylinder) | IEdge, IRefAxis, ICenterLine , ISketchLine (line) | IRefPoint , IVertex , ISketchPoint | IRefAxis, ISketchPoint, IRefPoint, IVertex (sphere) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IEdge (arc, circular edge) | ● | ● | ● | ● |  |  |
| IRefAxis (cone) | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● |  |
| IRefAxis (cylinder) | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● |
| IEdge, IRefAxis, ICenterLine, ISketchLine (line) | ● | ● | ● |  |  | ● |
| IRefPoint, IVertex, ISketchPoint |  | ● | ● |  |  | ● |
| IRefAxis, IRefPoint, ISketchPoint, IVertex (sphere) |  |  | ● | ● | ● | ● |

Instead of specifying this property, you can use[IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~SelectByID2.html)to pre-select the entities to mate using Mark = 1. You can pre-select mate entities during mate creation, but not during mate editing.
