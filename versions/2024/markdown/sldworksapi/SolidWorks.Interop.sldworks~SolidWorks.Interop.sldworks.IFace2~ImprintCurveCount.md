# ImprintCurveCount Method (IFace2)

Gets the number of new edges and faces to create when imprinting a curve.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub ImprintCurveCount( _
   ByVal Curve As Curve, _
   ByRef NewEdgeCount As System.Integer, _
   ByRef NewFaceCount As System.Integer _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFace2
Dim Curve As Curve
Dim NewEdgeCount As System.Integer
Dim NewFaceCount As System.Integer

instance.ImprintCurveCount(Curve, NewEdgeCount, NewFaceCount)
```

### C#

```csharp
void ImprintCurveCount(
   Curve Curve,
   out System.int NewEdgeCount,
   out System.int NewFaceCount
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void ImprintCurveCount(
   Curve^ Curve,
   [Out] System.int NewEdgeCount,
   [Out] System.int NewFaceCount
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Curve`: Pointer to the

[curve](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ICurve.html)
- `NewEdgeCount`: Number of new edges to create when imprinting this curveParamDesc
- `NewFaceCount`: Number of new faces to create when imprinting this curve

## VBA Syntax

See

[Face2::ImprintCurveCount](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Face2~ImprintCurveCount.html)

.

## Remarks

Call this method before calling[IFace2::IImprintCurve](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFace2~IImprintCurve.html)to get the size of the edges and faces arrays.
