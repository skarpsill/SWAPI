.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetBreakLineInfo() As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IView
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.GetBreakLineInfo()
```

### C#

```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ GetBreakLineInfo();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

Array of break line information (see**Remarks**)

## VBA Syntax

See

[View::GetBreakLineInfo](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~View~GetBreakLineInfo.html)

.

## Remarks

The return value is the following array of doubles:

[breaklineStyle, [ color, lineType, lineStyleIndex, lineWeight, layerId,

layerOverride, number of lines, number of arcs ], line data or arc data]

(Table)=========================================================

| breaklineStyle | Valid returns are found in swBreakLineStyle_e |
| --- | --- |
| color | COLORREF returned as an integer. Return value could be 0 or -1 for default color |
| lineType | Valid returns are found in swLineTypes_e . A lineType is a combination of a lineStyle and lineWeight. |
| LineStyleIndex | Valid line styles can be found in swLineStyles_e. |
| lineWeight | An integer value defining the line width. Valid width values can be found in swLineWeights_e . |
| layerId | An integer value indicating which layer holds this entity. The ILayer object can be obtained by passing this integer value to ILayerMgr::GetLayerById and ILayerMgr::IGetLayerId . |
| layerOverride | An integer with bit flags set to determine which properties, if any, have been overridden with respect to the Layer default properties. If the bit value is set, then the specific property or properties have been overridden. The bit indicators are: color = 0x1 style = 0x2 width = 0x4 Therefore, if LayerOverride is returned as 3, then the color and style were specifically set for this item and may not match the default values associated with this item's layer. |
| Number of lines | Number of pairs of lines in the break line. |
| Number of arcs | Number of pairs of arcs in the break line. |

Each break line is a pair of line segments:

(Table)=========================================================

| For... | Then... |
| --- | --- |
| swBreakLineStraight | Each has 1 line for a total of 4 points: LineStartPt[3] Line1EngPt[3] Line2StartPt[3] Line2EndPt[3] |
| swBreakLineZigZag | Each has 5 lines |
| swBreakLine_SmallZigZag | Each has 5 lines |
| swBreakLine_Curve | Each has 2 arcs; data is packed as follows: arcDirection startPoint EndPoint CenterPoint |
