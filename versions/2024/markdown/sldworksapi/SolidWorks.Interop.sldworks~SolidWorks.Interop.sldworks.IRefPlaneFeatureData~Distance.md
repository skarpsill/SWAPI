# Distance Property (IRefPlaneFeatureData)

Gets or sets the distance, in meters, to offset the reference plane feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property Distance As System.Double
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IRefPlaneFeatureData
Dim value As System.Double

instance.Distance = value

value = instance.Distance
```

### C#

```csharp
System.double Distance {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.double Distance {
   System.double get();
   void set (    System.double value);
}
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Property Value

Distance, in radians, to offset the reference plane

## VBA Syntax

## Remarks

IMPORTANT:

Reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2010 or later are constraint based; reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2009 or earlier are not. See the
