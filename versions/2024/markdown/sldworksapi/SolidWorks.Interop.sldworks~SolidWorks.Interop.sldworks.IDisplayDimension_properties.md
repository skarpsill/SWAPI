| Property | GridBubble | Gets or sets whether to display a grid bubble at the end of ordinate dimension extension lines. |
| Property | HorizontalJustification | Gets or sets the dimension text's horizontal justification. |
| Property | Inspection | Gets or sets whether a display dimension above the dimension line is displayed as an inspection dimension. |
| Property | IsLinked | Gets whether the dimension has text linked to it. |
| Property | Jogged | Gets or sets whether this ordinate or angular running dimension is jogged. |
| Property | LeaderVisibility | Gets or sets which leader lines (dimension lines) are visible on a display dimension. |
| Property | LowerInspection | Gets or sets whether a display dimension below the dimension line is displayed as an inspection dimension. |
| Property | MarkedForDrawing | Gets or sets whether this display dimension is marked to include in a drawing document. |
| Property | MaxWitnessLineLength | Gets or sets the maximum length of dimension extension lines. |
| Property | OffsetText | Gets or sets whether or not to offset the text of a dimension. |
| Property | RunBidirectionally | Gets or sets whether each dimension runs in a direction closest to the baseline in this angular running dimension. |
| Property | Scale2 | Gets or sets the scale value that is applied to the dimension value of this non-associative distance dimension. |
