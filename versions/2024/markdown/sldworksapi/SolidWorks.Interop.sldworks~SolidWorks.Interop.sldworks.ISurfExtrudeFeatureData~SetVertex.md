   ByVal Forward As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal Vtx As System.Object _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISurfExtrudeFeatureData
Dim Forward As System.Boolean
Dim Vtx As System.Object

instance.SetVertex(Forward, Vtx)
```

### C#

```csharp
void SetVertex(
   System.bool Forward,
   System.object Vtx
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void SetVertex(
   System.bool Forward,
   System.Object^ Vtx
)
```
