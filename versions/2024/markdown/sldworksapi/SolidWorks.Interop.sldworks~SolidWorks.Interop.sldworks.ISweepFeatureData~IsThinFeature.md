# IsThinFeature Method (ISweepFeatureData)

Gets whether this is a thin-walled sweep feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IsThinFeature() As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISweepFeatureData
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.IsThinFeature()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool IsThinFeature()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool IsThinFeature();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

True if a thin-walled sweep feature, false if not

## VBA Syntax

See

[SweepFeatureData::IsThinFeature](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~SweepFeatureData~IsThinFeature.html)

.

## Examples

See the

[ISweepFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISweepFeatureData.html)

examples.

## Remarks

Note that you can make a sweep feature thin-walled only by setting[ISweepFeatureData::ThinFeature](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISweepFeatureData~ThinFeature.html)at the time of creation.

This method is not valid for swept-surface features.

See[Accessing Selections that Define Features](sldworksAPIProgGuide.chm::/Miscellaneous/Accessing_Selections_that_Define_Features.htm)for additional details.
