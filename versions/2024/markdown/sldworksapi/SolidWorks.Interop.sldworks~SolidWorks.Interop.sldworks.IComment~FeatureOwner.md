# FeatureOwner Property (IComment)

Gets the feature that owns this comment.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
ReadOnly Property FeatureOwner As Feature
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IComment
Dim value As Feature

value = instance.FeatureOwner
```

### C#

```csharp
Feature FeatureOwner {get;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property Feature^ FeatureOwner {
   Feature^ get();
}
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Property Value

Pointer to the

[IFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature.html)

object that owns this comment

## VBA Syntax

See

[Comment::FeatureOwner](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Comment~FeatureOwner.html)

.

## Remarks

If the comment is not owned by a feature, then NULL is returned.

Because you cannot set the name of comment owned by a feature, use this property before using[IComment::Name](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IComment~Name.html)to determine if the comment is owned by a feature.
