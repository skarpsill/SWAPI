# SketchSplineByEqnParams2 Method (IModelDoc2)

Obsolete. Superseded by

[ISketchManager::CreateSplineByEqnParams](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchManager~CreateSplineByEqnParams.html)

.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function SketchSplineByEqnParams2( _
   ByVal ParamsIn As System.Object _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IModelDoc2
Dim ParamsIn As System.Object
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.SketchSplineByEqnParams2(ParamsIn)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool SketchSplineByEqnParams2(
   System.object ParamsIn
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool SketchSplineByEqnParams2(
   System.Object^ ParamsIn
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `ParamsIn`: Array containing an array of doubles (see

Remarks

)

### Return Value

True if created successfully, false if not

## VBA Syntax

See

[ModelDoc2::SketchSplineByEqnParams2](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~ModelDoc2~SketchSplineByEqnParams2.html)

.

## Examples

[Sketch a Spline (VBA)](Sketch_Spline_Example_VB.htm)

## Remarks

The parameters are provided as 3 arrays, which for OLE automation are packed into a single SafeArray packed as follows:

[Dimension, Order, Number of control Points, Periodicity, knot1, knot2,...,ControlPoint1[Dimension], ControlPoint2[Dimension],...]

Pass control point coordinates to this method in sketch space. The Z value is interpreted as 0. In certain situations, you must transform your b-curve parameters to sketch space with the help of[ISketch::ModelToSketchTransform](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketch~ModelToSketchTransform.html).

NOTE:If the spline being generated is a closed spline, then it must be flagged as periodic. In addition, splines generated in sketches must be G1 continuous. If the data passed to this method does not generate a G1 continuous spline, then it is rejected and a spline is not created. If yourdata is not G1 continuous, then you must split the spline into multiple G1 segments and call method for each segment.
