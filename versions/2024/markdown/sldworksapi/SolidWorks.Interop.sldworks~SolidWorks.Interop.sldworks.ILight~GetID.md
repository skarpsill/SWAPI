## Remarks

A light ID:

- is unique within the document.
- is persistent across SOLIDWORKS sessions and never changes, even if you change the name of the light.
- can be used to identify a specific light in a document.
- cannot be assigned by applications or users.
- is not the same as a

  [persistent reference ID](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/overview/Persistent_Reference_IDs.htm)

  . You can get a light using its persistent reference ID, but you cannot get a light using this method.
