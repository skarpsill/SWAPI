## Remarks

This interface:

- Accesses the feature data for a thread created either inside a cylindrical hole or around a cylindrical rod.
- Is functionally similar to the Thread PropertyManager in the SOLIDWORKS user interface.

To create a Thread feature, see[Thread Features and ThreadFeatureData Objects](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/Thread_Features_and_ThreadFeatureData_Objects.htm).

For more information, see the**Thread PropertyManager**topic in the SOLIDWORKS user-interface help.
