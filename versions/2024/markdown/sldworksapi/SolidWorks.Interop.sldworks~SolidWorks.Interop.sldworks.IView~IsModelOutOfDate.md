.

## Remarks

A model can be out-of-date in a Detached drawing where the model is not loaded, if any of the views in any of the sheets in the drawing refers to a model that has been modified and saved to disk since this drawing was last saved. This situation is flagged upon opening a document as well.

If you are using[ISldWorks::OpenDoc6](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~OpenDoc6.html)with the silent option enabled, this warning is returned via the Warnings argument by value swFileLoadWarning_ModelOutOfDate. If you print this drawing and have the swRapidDraftPrintOutOfSynchWaterMark user preference enabled (see[ISldWorks::SetUserPreferenceToggle](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~SetUserPreferenceToggle.html)), then the printout will indicate this drawing as being out-of-synch.
