# Add Components Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to add multiple components
to an assembly.

```vb
 '----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
 ' 1. Create a new part document.
 '    a. Extrude a rectangular block and cut-extrude a diagonal section
'        off one face of the block.
 '    b. Click Insert > Reference Geometry > Coordinate System.
 '    c. Select a corner of the block for the origin of the new coordinate system.
 '    d. Select an edge for the Z axis of the coordinate system.
 '    e. Click the green check mark to save the coordinate system.
 '       Coordinate System1 appears in the FeatureManager design tree.
 '    f. Save and minimize the part.
 ' 2. Replace <component_name> in the code with the full path name of
'      the new part.
 ' 3. Create a new assembly document.
 '    a. Create a line segment sketch originating at some distance
'       from the default origin of the assembly document.
 '    b. Click Insert > Reference Geometry > Coordinate System.
 '    c. Select one end point of the line segment for the origin of
'       the new coordinate system.
 '    d. Select the line segment for the X axis of the coordinate system.
 '    e. Click the green check mark to save the coordinate system.
 '       Coordinate System1 appears in the FeatureManager design tree.
 '    f. Right-click on Coordinate System1 in the FeatureManager design tree,
'       select Feature Properties, and rename the coordinate system
'       and its description to differ from Coordinate System1.
 '    g. Save the assembly.
 ' 4. Open an Immediate window.
 ' 5. Activate the assembly document.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' Component part is inserted into the assembly such that
 ' the part's Coordinate System1 is coincident (no translation or rotation)
 ' with the assembly's default (not user-defined) coordinate system.
