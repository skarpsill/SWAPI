Gets all of the bodies created by splitting a part.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function PreSplitBody2() As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeatureManager
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.PreSplitBody2()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object PreSplitBody2()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ PreSplitBody2();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

Array of

[bodies](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IBody2.html)

that result from splitting a part (see

Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

See

[FeatureManager::PreSplitBody2](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~FeatureManager~PreSplitBody2.html)

.

## Examples

[Create Split Feature (VBA)](Create_Split-body_Feature_Example_VB.htm)

## Remarks

The difference between this method and the now obsolete IFeatureManager::PreSplitBody is that this method supports the splitting of surfaces.

To create a Split feature:

1. Select the cutting tools to use to split the part into multiple bodies.
2. Call this method to get all of the split bodies.
3. Create the Split feature using[IFeatureManager::PostSplitBody](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~PostSplitBody.html).

To find out whether the bodies in a Split feature are consumed, use[ISplitBodyFeatureData::Consume](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISplitBodyFeatureData~Consume.html).
