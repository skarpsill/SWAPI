# GetEdges Method (IRuledSurfaceFeatureData)

Gets the edges to used as the base for this ruled-surface feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub GetEdges( _
   ByRef Edges As System.Object, _
   ByRef SideFlags As System.Object _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IRuledSurfaceFeatureData
Dim Edges As System.Object
Dim SideFlags As System.Object

instance.GetEdges(Edges, SideFlags)
```

### C#

```csharp
void GetEdges(
   out System.object Edges,
   out System.object SideFlags
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void GetEdges(
   [Out] System.Object^ Edges,
   [Out] System.Object^ SideFlags
)
```

NOTE:

### Parameters

- `Edges`: Array of

[edges](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IEdge.html)
- `SideFlags`: Array of flags indicating which side of each edge to create the ruled-surface feature
