## Remarks

This method only deletes cosmetic threads in a drawing of an assembly; this method does not delete cosmetic threads in a drawing of a part.

By default, cosmetic threads are not imported into an drawing of an assembly for performance reasons, but are imported into a drawing of part and belong to the features in the part; thus, they cannot be deleted using this method.

This method also does not delete any cosmetic threads with callouts in a drawing of an assembly.
