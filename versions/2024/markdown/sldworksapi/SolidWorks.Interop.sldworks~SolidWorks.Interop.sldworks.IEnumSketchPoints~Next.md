# Next Method (IEnumSketchPoints)

Gets the next sketch point in the sketch points enumeration.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub Next( _
   ByVal Celt As System.Integer, _
   ByRef Rgelt As SketchPoint, _
   ByRef PceltFetched As System.Integer _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IEnumSketchPoints
Dim Celt As System.Integer
Dim Rgelt As SketchPoint
Dim PceltFetched As System.Integer

instance.Next(Celt, Rgelt, PceltFetched)
```

### C#

```csharp
void Next(
   System.int Celt,
   out SketchPoint Rgelt,
   out System.int PceltFetched
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void Next(
   System.int Celt,
   [Out] SketchPoint^ Rgelt,
   [Out] System.int PceltFetched
)
```

NOTE:

### Parameters

- `Celt`: Number of sketch points for the sketch points enumeration
- `Rgelt`: Pointer to an array of

[sketch points](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchPoint.html)

of size Celt
- `PceltFetched`: Pointer to the number of sketch points returned from the list; this value can be less than celt if you ask for more sketch points than exist, or it can be NULL if no more sketch points exist
