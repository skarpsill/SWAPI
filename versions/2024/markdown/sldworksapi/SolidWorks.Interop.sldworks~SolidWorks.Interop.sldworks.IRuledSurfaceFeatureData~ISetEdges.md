# ISetEdges Method (IRuledSurfaceFeatureData)

Sets the edge to use as the base for this ruled-surface feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub ISetEdges( _
   ByVal Count As System.Integer, _
   ByRef Entities As System.Object, _
   ByRef SideFlags As System.Integer _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IRuledSurfaceFeatureData
Dim Count As System.Integer
Dim Entities As System.Object
Dim SideFlags As System.Integer

instance.ISetEdges(Count, Entities, SideFlags)
```

### C#

```csharp
void ISetEdges(
   System.int Count,
   ref System.object Entities,
   ref System.int SideFlags
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void ISetEdges(
   System.int Count,
   System.Object^% Entities,
   System.int% SideFlags
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Count`: Number of edges
- `Entities`: Array of

[edges](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IEdge.html)
- `SideFlags`: - in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of flags indicating which side of each edge to create the ruled-surface feature

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported
