' 1. Gets the number of minor grid lines between
'    the major grid lines.
' 2. Sets the number of minor grid lines between
'    major grid lines to 15.

```
    Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
    Set swModel = swApp.ActiveDoc
    Debug.Print "Current minor grid lines between major grid lines: " & swModel.GetUserPreferenceIntegerValue(swGridMinorLinesPerMajor)
    bReturnValue = swModel.SetUserPreferenceIntegerValue(swGridMinorLinesPerMajor, 15)
    Debug.Print "Modified minor grid lines between major grid lines: " & swModel.GetUserPreferenceIntegerValue(swGridMinorLinesPerMajor)
