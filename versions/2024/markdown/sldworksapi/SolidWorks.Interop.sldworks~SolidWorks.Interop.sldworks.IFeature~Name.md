## Remarks

Feature names can be seen in the FeatureManager design tree of any part or assembly.

Any change to a feature name is not visible to the user until a rebuild has been done. See[IModelDoc2::EditRebuild3](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~EditRebuild3.html).

If you are setting the name of a feature, then the new name must be unique in the FeatureManager design tree. If the name is not unique, then the name is not changed. Also, the name cannot contain characters that are reserved by SOLIDWORKS.
