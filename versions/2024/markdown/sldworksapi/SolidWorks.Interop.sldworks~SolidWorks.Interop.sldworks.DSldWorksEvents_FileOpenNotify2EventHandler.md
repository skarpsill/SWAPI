.

## VBA Syntax

See

[FileOpenNotify2 Event (SldWorks)](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/SldWorks~SldWorks~FileOpenNotify2_EV.html)

.

## Remarks

You can use[ISldWorks::GetOpenDocumentByName](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~GetOpenDocumentByName.html)or[ISldWorks::IGetOpenDocumentByName2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~IGetOpenDocumentByName2.html)with FileNameto get a pointer to the newly opened document. Because it is possible to have a NULL active document when an add-in is notified by swAppFileOpenNotify2, use[ISldWorks::IGetOpenDocumentByName2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~IGetOpenDocumentByName2.html)instead of[ISldWorks::IActiveDoc2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~IActiveDoc2.html).

This event is very similar to the now obsolete SldWorks events[FileOpenNotify](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.DSldWorksEvents_FileOpenNotifyEventHandler.html)event. The difference is that the SOLIDWORKS event FileOpenNotify2 is fired later in the process than the SOLIDWORKS event FileOpenNotify, so that if end-users respond to the event by opening a new part, then NewDocument, NewPart, NewAssembly, or NewDrawing2 is successful.

This event is sent to any application when a file is opened programmatically using[ISldWorks::OpenDoc6](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~OpenDoc6.html). Your application can detect the newly opened document by watching the the SOLIDWORKS events[ActiveModelDocChangeNotify](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.DSldWorksEvents_ActiveDocChangeNotifyEventHandler.html)event.

With the exception of Parasolid files (that is, *.x_t, *.x_b), this event is not sent for the opening of non-native SOLIDWORKS files (that is, *.igs, *.dxf, and so on).kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}Opening non-native files is typically handled with the creation of a new SOLIDWORKS file (that is, *.sldprt, *.sldasm, *.slddrw) and the subsequent construction of the foreign geometry within that file.

If developing a C++ application, use[swAppFileOpenNotify2](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swAppNotify_e.html)to register for this notification.
