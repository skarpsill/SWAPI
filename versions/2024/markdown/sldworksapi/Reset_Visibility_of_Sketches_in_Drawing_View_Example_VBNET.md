# Reset Visibility of Sketches in Drawing View Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to reset the visibility of any hidden sketches in a
drawing view so that the drawing view reflects the model.

```
'--------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions: Verify that the specified drawing
' to open document exists.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Opens the specified drawing document.
' 2. Examine the drawing, then press F5.
' 3. Activates a drawing view and hides
'    a sketch in that drawing view.
' 4. After examining the drawing to verify,
'    press F5.
' 5. Selects the drawing view with the hidden sketch
'    and resets the visibility of all sketches in
'    that drawing view so that the drawing view reflects
'    the model.
' 6. Examine the drawing to verify that the hidden
'    sketch is visible.
'
' NOTE: Because this drawing is used elsewhere, do
' not save changes.
