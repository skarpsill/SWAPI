# ISetVertex Method (ISurfExtrudeFeatureData)

Sets the end condition vertex in the forward or reverse direction for this extruded surface.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub ISetVertex( _
   ByVal Forward As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal Vtx As Vertex _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISurfExtrudeFeatureData
Dim Forward As System.Boolean
Dim Vtx As Vertex

instance.ISetVertex(Forward, Vtx)
```

### C#

```csharp
void ISetVertex(
   System.bool Forward,
   Vertex Vtx
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void ISetVertex(
   System.bool Forward,
   Vertex^ Vtx
)
```
