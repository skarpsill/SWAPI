# Type Property (IRefPlaneFeatureData)

Gets the type of reference plane created in SOLIDWORKS 2009 or earlier. Can also get whether a constraint-based reference plane created in SOLIDWORKS 2010 or has angle or offset distance references.**NOTE:****This property is a get-only property.**Set is not implemented .

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property Type As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IRefPlaneFeatureData
Dim value As System.Integer

instance.Type = value

value = instance.Type
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int Type {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.int Type {
   System.int get();
   void set (    System.int value);
}
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Property Value

Type of reference plane as defined in[swRefPlaneType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swRefPlaneType_e.html)

## VBA Syntax

See

[RefPlaneFeatureData::Type](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~RefPlaneFeatureData~Type.html)

.

## Examples

[Insert Reference Plane (C#)](Insert_Reference_Plane_Example_CSharp.htm)

[Insert Reference Plane (VB.NET)](Insert_Reference_Plane_Example_VBNET.htm)

[Insert Reference Plane (VBA)](Insert_Reference_Plane_Example_VB.htm)

## Remarks

**IMPORTANT:**Reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2010 or later are constraint based; reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2009 or earlier are not. See the**Remarks**section in the[IRefPlaneFeatureData interface](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IRefPlaneFeatureData.html)topic for details about reference planes and this interface.
