# IGetSketchBlockInstances Method (ISketch)

Gets the block instances in this sketch (i.e., the sketch under which the block instances are displayed in the FeatureManager design tree).

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetSketchBlockInstances( _
   ByVal Count As System.Integer _
) As SketchBlockInstance
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISketch
Dim Count As System.Integer
Dim value As SketchBlockInstance

value = instance.IGetSketchBlockInstances(Count)
```

### C#

```csharp
SketchBlockInstance IGetSketchBlockInstances(
   System.int Count
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
SketchBlockInstance^ IGetSketchBlockInstances(
   System.int Count
)
```

NOTE:

### Parameters

- `Count`: Number of block instances in this sketch

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array containing the

  [block instances](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchBlockInstance.html)

  in this sketch
