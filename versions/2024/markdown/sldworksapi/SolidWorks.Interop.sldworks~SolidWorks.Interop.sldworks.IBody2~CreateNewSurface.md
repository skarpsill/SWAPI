# CreateNewSurface Method (IBody2)

Creates a handle for a new surface to serve as geometry for a face to be added to the body.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function CreateNewSurface() As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IBody2
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.CreateNewSurface()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object CreateNewSurface()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ CreateNewSurface();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

New surface

## VBA Syntax

See

[Body2::CreateNewSurface](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Body2~CreateNewSurface.html)

.

## Remarks

This method is the first in a set of related functions that construct a body from trimmed surfaces. Internally, this function also creates a list that SOLIDWORKS uses as a place-holder for trimming curves used to trim the surface to the desired shape.

Any existing object created by this method is destroyed if you call this method again.
