# SetExtractionDirection Method (ICoreFeatureData)

Sets the entities that define the extraction direction of this core feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function SetExtractionDirection( _
   ByVal PDir1 As System.Object, _
   ByVal PDir2 As System.Object _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICoreFeatureData
Dim PDir1 As System.Object
Dim PDir2 As System.Object
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.SetExtractionDirection(PDir1, PDir2)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool SetExtractionDirection(
   System.object PDir1,
   System.object PDir2
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool SetExtractionDirection(
   System.Object^ PDir1,
   System.Object^ PDir2
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `PDir1`: Entity that defines the extraction direction (see

Remarks

)
- `PDir2`: Entity that defines the extraction direction (see

Remarks

)

### Return Value

True if the entities that define the extraction direction of this core feature are set, false if not

## VBA Syntax

See

[CoreFeatureData::SetExtractionDirection](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~CoreFeatureData~SetExtractionDirection.html)

.

## Remarks

The types of entities that define the extraction direction are:

- Face
- Plane
- Edge
- Vertex
- Sketch line
- Sketch point

There can be two entities because two sketch points can specify a direction.
