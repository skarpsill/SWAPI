## Remarks

If the user tries to close the part, theDo you wish to save changes?dialog is displayed.

If SOLIDWORKS data has changed, this method marks the SOLIDWORKS document as dirty so that the end-user is prompted when attempting to close the document. You might want to use this method with applications that use[IModelDoc2::IGet3rdPartyStorage](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~IGet3rdPartyStorage.html)to save stream data in SOLIDWORKS files.

If you have programmatically changed the SOLIDWORKS model, using this method is not necessary because the SOLIDWORKS document is flagged as dirty automatically.
