# Apply and Remove Texture To and From Component By Display State Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to apply and remove texture to and from a component
using the name of a display state of the model.

```
'-------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Verify that the specified assembly to open and texture exist.
' 2. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Opens the specified assembly and applies texture to
'    the selected component.
' 2. Examine the Immediate window.
' 3. Click anywhere in the SOLIDWORKS window
'    to verify that the texture was applied.
' 4. Follow the instructions in the macro
'    to remove the just-applied texture.
' 5. Run the macro again.
' 6. Examine the Immediate window.
' 7. Click anywhere in the SOLIDWORKS window to verify
'    that the texture was removed.
'
' NOTE: Because this assembly document is used elsewhere,
' do not save changes.
