# Using SwAddin to Create a SOLIDWORKS Addin

## Using SwAddin to Create a SOLIDWORKS Add-In

You can create a SOLIDWORKS add-in using the[ISwAddin](swpublishedAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.swpublished~SolidWorks.interop.swpublished.ISwAddin.html)object instead of using a[SOLIDWORKS
add-in wizard](SolidWorks_API_Add-Ins,_Project_Templates,_and_Wizards.htm).

When you use the ISwAddin object to create a SOLIDWORKS add-in, the
add-in must include some specific functionality and code. It is also important
to understand what the SOLIDWORKS software does for the add-in. Click
a link to read that section.

  do?](#addin)
- [What does the SOLIDWORKS
  software do?](#application)

### What does the add-in have to do?

The add-in DLL must be created as a COM Server and it must:

1. Implement a co-creatable object that supports
  SwAddin.
2. During installation call:

- Regsvr32.exe

  for
  unmanaged C++ and managed C++/CLI add-ins. See

  [How to use the
  Regsvr32 tool and troubleshoot Regsvr32 error messages](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/249873)

  for details.

Register the
add-in's CLSID in**HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\SOLIDWORKS\AddIns**and set
the following registry keys:

- Default

  to 1 or 0, where 1 enables the add-in in the add-in
  manager so that it loads when the user starts the SOLIDWORKS software.
- Description

  to a text description of the add-in that is displayed
  in the add-in manager.
- Title

  to a text title of the description that is displayed in
  the add-in manager.

- RegAsm.exe

  for C#
  and VB.NET add-ins. See

  [Registering Assemblies with COM](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/h627s4zy(v=vs.110).aspx)

  for details.

1. Define event handlers as needed.

In its implementation of[ISwAddin::ConnectToSW](swpublishedAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.swpublished~SolidWorks.interop.swpublished.ISwAddin~ConnectToSW.html),
the add-in can:

1. Call[ISldWorks::SetAddinCallbackInfo](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~SetAddinCallbackInfo.html)and pass the instance handle of the add-in and the object that supports
  the callback methods. The SOLIDWORKS software holds onto this object and
  makes callbacks.
2. Call[ISldWorks::AddMenuItem3](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~AddMenuItem3.html)and pass the callback method associated with the menu item.
3. Call[ISldWorks::AddToolbar4](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~AddToolbar4.html)and pass the callback method associated with the toolbar button.

### What does the SOLIDWORKS software do?

When the end-user starts the SOLIDWORKS software, it:

1. Checks the registry for add-ins.
2. Creates an object associated with the CLSID of
  the add-in.
3. Performs a QueryInterface on the add-in looking
  for the SwAddin object.
4. Calls[ISwAddin::ConnectToSW](swpublishedAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.swpublished~SolidWorks.interop.swpublished.ISwAddin~ConnectToSW.html)and passes a pointer to the SOLIDWORKS session and the add-in ID.

When the user closes the SOLIDWORKS software or disables an add-in in
the add-in Manager, the SOLIDWORKS software:

1. Calls[ISwAddin::DisconnectFromSW](swpublishedAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.swpublished~SolidWorks.interop.swpublished.ISwAddin~DisconnectFromSW.html),
  providing the add-in an opportunity for cleanup.
2. Destroys the object it created with the add-in
  CLSID.

If the end-user disables an add-in in the add-in manager, the SOLIDWORKS
software does not reload the next time the SOLIDWORKS software starts.
If the end-user closes the SOLIDWORKS software with an add-in enabled,
the SOLIDWORKS software reloads the add-in the next time it starts.
