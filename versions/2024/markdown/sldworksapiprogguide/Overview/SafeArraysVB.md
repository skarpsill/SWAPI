# Passing SafeArrays in VB

## Passing SafeArrays in Visual Basic for Applications

Passing array data to SOLIDWORKS in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) requires the use of
a VARIANT variable to hold the data. Put the data into an array andkadov_tag{{</spaces>}}assign a VARIANT to the array. Pass the VARIANT enclosed
in parentheses to the API function.

Dim varArray As Variant

Dim DataArray(9) As double

' Assign values

DataArray(0) = 0.1

...

' Pass the data in a VARIANT to a SOLIDWORKS
method

varArray = DataArray

Result = Object.Method( (varArray) ) '
The extra parentheses are required
