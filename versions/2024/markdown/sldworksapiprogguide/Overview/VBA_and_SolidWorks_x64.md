# VBA and SOLIDWORKS x64

SOLIDWORKS 2013 SP0, and later, include a new version of Microsoft Visual
Basic for Applications (VBA 7), which supports both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.

- Declare

  statements in VBA macros and applications created before the SOLIDWORKS 2013
  release will not compile in VBA 7 on 64-bit systems. You must mark

  Declare

  statements as safe by using the

  PtrSafe

  attribute in your VBA macros and applications on 64-bit systems.

  Use the

  LongPtr

  variable type instead of the

  Long

  or

  LongLong

  variable types for function arguments representing pointers if
  your VBA macro or application must work with both 32-bit and 64-bit
  SOLIDWORKS.

  The

  LongPtr

  variable type and the

  PtrSafe

  attribute allow you
  to use the same

  Declare

  statement on either 32-bit or 64-bit systems.

- 32-bit

  ActiveX controls used by
  VBA macros with

  SOLIDWORKS 2012 and
  earlier:

  - must be recompiled on a
    64-bit system.
  - will continue to work on
    a 32-bit system.

For more information about VBA 7, see Microsoft's:
