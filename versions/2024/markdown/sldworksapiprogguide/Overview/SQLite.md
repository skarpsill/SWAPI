# SQLite

Only one instance of SQLite can run in SOLIDWORKS process space. SOLIDWORKS
maintains a reference to the SQLite singleton. To ensure compatiblity, your
SOLIDWORKS add-in must use a version of**System.Data.SQLite.dll**that is
the same as the version used by SOLIDWORKS. In File Explorer, place your
cursor over`install_dir`**\System.Data.SQLite.dll**to get the version
used by your SOLIDWORKS installation.

For example, if you discover that SOLIDWORKS uses SQLite version 1.0.76.0,
then download and set up the compatible SQLite version for your add-in:

**http://system.data.sqlite.org/downloads/1.0.76.0/sqlite-netFx40-setup-bundle-x64-2010-1.0.76.0.exe**
