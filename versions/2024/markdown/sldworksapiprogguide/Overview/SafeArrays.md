# Passing SafeArrays in C++

Be careful when managing SafeArray memory. If you receive a SafeArray from
SOLIDWORKS, you are responsible for destroying it. Also,
if you pass a SafeArray to SOLIDWORKS, then SOLIDWORKS does not
destroy the SafeArray. You are responsible for destroying the SafeArray.

See:

- [Return Values](Return_Values.htm)for information and examples of handling SafeArray and Variant return
  values.
- [STL Container Classes and Smart Pointers](STL_Container_Classes_and_Smart_Pointers.htm)for information
  about using smart pointers with container classes.
