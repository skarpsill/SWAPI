# Macro Features, Configurations, and Dimensions

## Macro Features and Configurations

When working with configurable dimensions and a macro feature, only
your[edit definition function](Edit_Definition_Function.htm)should take into consideration configurations. In your edit definition
function, you can use[IDimension::SetSystemValue3](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IDimension~SetSystemValue3.html)or[IDimension::ISetSystemValue3](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IDimension~ISetSystemValue3.html)to modify dimensions values as per the user’s changes. This is similar
to how it works in the SOLIDWORKS user-interface when modifying feature
dimensions across configurations.

Your[rebuild function](Rebuild_Function.htm)should not
attempt to modify dimensions across configurations.
