Function GetNominalCompoundWidth( _
   ByRef width As System.Double, _
   ByRef X As System.Double, _
   ByRef Y As System.Double, _
   ByRef Z As System.Double, _
   ByRef I As System.Double, _
   ByRef J As System.Double, _
   ByRef K As System.Double _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISwDMDimXpertCompoundWidthFeature
Dim width As System.Double
Dim X As System.Double
Dim Y As System.Double
Dim Z As System.Double
Dim I As System.Double
Dim J As System.Double
Dim K As System.Double
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.GetNominalCompoundWidth(width, X, Y, Z, I, J, K)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool GetNominalCompoundWidth(
   out System.double width,
