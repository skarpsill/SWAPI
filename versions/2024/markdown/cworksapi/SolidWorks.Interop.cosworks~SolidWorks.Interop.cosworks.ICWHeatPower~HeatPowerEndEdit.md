# HeatPowerEndEdit Method (ICWHeatPower)

Ends editing heat power.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function HeatPowerEndEdit() As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICWHeatPower
Dim value As System.Integer

value = instance.HeatPowerEndEdit()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int HeatPowerEndEdit()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.int HeatPowerEndEdit();
```

### Return Value

Error as defined in[swsHeatPowerEndEditError_e](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks.swsHeatPowerEndEditError_e.html)

## VBA Syntax

See

[CWHeatPower::HeatPowerEndEdit](ms-its:cworksapivb6.chm::/CosmosWorksLib~CWHeatPower~HeatPowerEndEdit.html)

## Remarks

You must call

[ICWHeatPower::HeatPowerBeginEdit](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks.ICWHeatPower~HeatPowerBeginEdit.html)

to start editing heat power. To ends editing heat power, you must call this method. Changes are not applied unless you call both methods.
