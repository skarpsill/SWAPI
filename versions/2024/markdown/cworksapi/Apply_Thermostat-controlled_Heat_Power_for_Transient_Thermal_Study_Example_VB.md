# Apply Thermostat-controlled Heat Power for Transient Thermal Study Example (VBA)

This example shows how to apply thermostat-controlled heat power and flux in
a transient thermal study.

```vb
 '---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
 ' 1. Add the SOLIDWORKS Simulation as an add-in (in SOLIDWORKS, click
 '    Tools > Add-ins > SOLIDWORKS Simulation > OK).
 ' 2. Add the SOLIDWORKS Simulation type library as a reference (in the IDE,
 '    click Tools > References > SOLIDWORKS Simulation version type library).
 ' 3. Ensure that c:\temp exists.
 ' 4. Ensure that the specified material library exists.
 ' 5. Ensure that the specified model document exists.
 ' 6. Open the Immediate window.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 '  1. Opens the specified model document.
 '  2. Creates Thermal_One study.
 '  3. Defines default thermal study results plot and plot options.
 '  4. Applies user-defined and SOLIDWORKS materials to components.
 '  5. Specifies initial temperatures for assembly components.
 '  6. Specifies thermostat location and the temperature range.
 '  7. Prints heat flux properties to the Immediate window.
 '  8. Prints radiation properties to the Immediate window.
 '  9. Meshes the model.
 ' 10. Analyzes Thermal_One.
 ' 11. Creates 60 thermal plots.
 ' 12. Saves the Thermal1 results plot as an eDrawings document in c:\temp.
 ' 13. Exports Thermal_One study to the NASTRAN finite-element analysis program
 '     in c:\temp.
 ' 14. Renames Thermal_One study to TransientThermal.
 ' 15. Inspect the Immediate window, the Simulation study tree,
 '     and the graphics area.
 '
 ' NOTES:
 '  * To get persistent reference identifiers (PIDs) for model selections,
 '    you can use pidcollector.exe or IModelDocExtension::GetPersistReference3.
 '  * Solving this study can take some time. Examine the Immediate window
 '    to monitor the macro's progress. Done! indicates that the macro
 '    has finished.
 '  * Because the assembly is used elsewhere, do not save any changes.
