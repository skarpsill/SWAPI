Dim instance As ICWHeatPower

instance.HeatPowerBeginEdit()
```

### C#

```csharp
void HeatPowerBeginEdit()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void HeatPowerBeginEdit();
```

## VBA Syntax

See

## Remarks

To start editing heat power, you must call this method. You must call

[ICWHeatPower::HeatPowerBeginEdit](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks.ICWHeatPower~HeatPowerEndEdit.html)

to end editing heat power. Changes are not applied unless you call both methods.
