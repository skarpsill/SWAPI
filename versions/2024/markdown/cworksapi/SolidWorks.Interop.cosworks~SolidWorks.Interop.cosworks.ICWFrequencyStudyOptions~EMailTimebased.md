# EMailTimebased Property (ICWFrequencyStudyOptions)

Obsolete. Superseded by[ICWFrequencyStudyOptions::EmailTimebased2](SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks~SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks.ICWFrequencyStudyOptions~EMailTimebased2.html).

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property EMailTimebased As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICWFrequencyStudyOptions
Dim value As System.Integer

instance.EMailTimebased = value

value = instance.EMailTimebased
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int EMailTimebased {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.int EMailTimebased {
   System.int get();
   void set (    System.int value);
}
```

### Property Value

1 to send email notifications during simulations, 0 to not

## VBA Syntax

See

[CWFrequencyStudyOptions::EMailTimebased](ms-its:cworksapivb6.chm::/CosmosWorksLib~CWFrequencyStudyOptions~EMailTimebased.html)

.

## Remarks

This property is valid only if[ICWFrequencyStudyOptions::EMail](SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks~SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks.ICWFrequencyStudyOptions~EMail.html)is set to 1.

If this property is set to 1, use[ICWFrequencyStudyOptions::EMailInterval](SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks~SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks.ICWFrequencyStudyOptions~EMailInterval.html)and[ICWFrequencyStudyOptions::EMailIntervalUnit](SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks~SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks.ICWFrequencyStudyOptions~EMailIntervalUnit.html)to specify the time interval for sending email notifications during simulations.
