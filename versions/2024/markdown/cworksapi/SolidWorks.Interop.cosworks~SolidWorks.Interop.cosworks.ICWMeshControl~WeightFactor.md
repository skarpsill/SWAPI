Dim instance As ICWMeshControl
Dim value As System.Double

instance.WeightFactor = value

value = instance.WeightFactor
```

### C#

```csharp
System.double WeightFactor {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.double WeightFactor {
   System.double get();
   void set (    System.double value);
}
```

### Property Value

Component weight factor as defined in
