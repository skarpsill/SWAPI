# SetThermostat Method (ICWHeatPower)

Sets a vertex for the location of a thermostat for heat power.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub SetThermostat( _
   ByVal DispVertex As System.Object _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICWHeatPower
Dim DispVertex As System.Object

instance.SetThermostat(DispVertex)
```

### C#

```csharp
void SetThermostat(
   System.object DispVertex
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void SetThermostat(
   System.Object^ DispVertex
)
```

### Parameters

- `DispVertex`: Vertex for the location of a thermostat
