# GetBeamForcesForEntities Method (ICWResults)

Gets the force values for the specified force for the selected beams.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetBeamForcesForEntities( _
   ByVal NComponent As System.Integer, _
   ByVal NStepNumber As System.Integer, _
   ByVal ArraySelectedEntities As System.Object, _
   ByVal NUnits As System.Integer, _
   ByRef ErrorCode As System.Integer _
) As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICWResults
Dim NComponent As System.Integer
Dim NStepNumber As System.Integer
Dim ArraySelectedEntities As System.Object
Dim NUnits As System.Integer
Dim ErrorCode As System.Integer
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.GetBeamForcesForEntities(NComponent, NStepNumber, ArraySelectedEntities, NUnits, ErrorCode)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object GetBeamForcesForEntities(
   System.int NComponent,
   System.int NStepNumber,
   System.object ArraySelectedEntities,
   System.int NUnits,
   out System.int ErrorCode
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ GetBeamForcesForEntities(
   System.int NComponent,
   System.int NStepNumber,
   System.Object^ ArraySelectedEntities,
   System.int NUnits,
   [Out] System.int ErrorCode
)
```

### Parameters

- `NComponent`: Force or moment or torque load to apply to selected entities as defined by[swsBeamForceType_e](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks.swsBeamForceType_e.html)
- `NStepNumber`: Number of steps to complete a non-linear analysis; otherwise, value is 1
- `ArraySelectedEntities`: Selected

[beams](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks.ICWBeamBody.html)
- `NUnits`: Unit as defined by

[swsUnit_e](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks.swsUnit_e.html)
- `ErrorCode`: Error as defined by

[swsResultsError_e](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks.swsResultsError_e.html)

### Return Value

Array of the values of the specified forces for the elements of the selected beams. Every element has two ends, so the output is as follows:

- Beam element number
- End1 force
- End2 force
- Beam element number
- End1 force
- End2 force
- etc.
