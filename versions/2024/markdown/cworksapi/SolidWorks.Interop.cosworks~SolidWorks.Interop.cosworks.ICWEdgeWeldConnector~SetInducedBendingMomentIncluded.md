# SetInducedBendingMomentIncluded Method (ICWEdgeWeldConnector)

Sets whether to include the induced bending moment due to asymmetry of the joint loading.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function SetInducedBendingMomentIncluded( _
   ByVal BIncluded As System.Boolean _
) As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICWEdgeWeldConnector
Dim BIncluded As System.Boolean
Dim value As System.Integer

value = instance.SetInducedBendingMomentIncluded(BIncluded)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int SetInducedBendingMomentIncluded(
   System.bool BIncluded
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.int SetInducedBendingMomentIncluded(
   System.bool BIncluded
)
```

### Parameters

- `BIncluded`: True to include the induced bending moment, false to not

### Return Value

Error code as defined in
