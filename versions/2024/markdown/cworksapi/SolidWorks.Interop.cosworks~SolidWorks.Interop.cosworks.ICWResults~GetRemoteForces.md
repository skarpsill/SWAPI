# GetRemoteForces Method (ICWResults)

Gets the x-, y-, and z-component and resultant forces applied to selected entities as a result of transferring a remote load in static studies.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetRemoteForces( _
   ByVal NStepNumber As System.Integer, _
   ByVal DispPlane As System.Object, _
   ByVal ArraySelectedEntities As System.Object, _
   ByVal NUnits As System.Integer, _
   ByRef ErrorCode As System.Integer _
) As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICWResults
Dim NStepNumber As System.Integer
Dim DispPlane As System.Object
Dim ArraySelectedEntities As System.Object
Dim NUnits As System.Integer
Dim ErrorCode As System.Integer
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.GetRemoteForces(NStepNumber, DispPlane, ArraySelectedEntities, NUnits, ErrorCode)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object GetRemoteForces(
   System.int NStepNumber,
   System.object DispPlane,
   System.object ArraySelectedEntities,
   System.int NUnits,
   out System.int ErrorCode
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ GetRemoteForces(
   System.int NStepNumber,
   System.Object^ DispPlane,
   System.Object^ ArraySelectedEntities,
   System.int NUnits,
   [Out] System.int ErrorCode
)
```

### Parameters

- `NStepNumber`: Solution step number (use 1 for static)
- `DispPlane`: Plane, axis, or coordinate system relative to which the results are listed
- `ArraySelectedEntities`: Selected faces, edges (shells only), vertices, and components
- `NUnits`: Output units as defined in

[swsUnit_e](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks.swsUnit_e.html)
- `ErrorCode`: Error as defined in[swsResultsError_e](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks.swsResultsError_e.html)

### Return Value

Array of four doubles of the remote load forces for all selections in ArraySelectedEntities:

1. Summation of x-components of remote load forces for all selections
2. Summation of y-components of remote load forces for all selections
3. Summation of z-components of remote load forces for all selections
4. Resultant remote load force for all selections
