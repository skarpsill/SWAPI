# swTwistControlType_e Enumeration

Sweep twist control options.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Public Enum swTwistControlType_e
   Inherits System.Enum
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As swTwistControlType_e
```

### C#

public enum swTwistControlType_e : System.Enum
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
public enum class swTwistControlType_e : public System.Enum
```

## Members

| Member | Description |
| --- | --- |
| swTwistControlConstantTwistAlongPath | 8 = Defines the twist of the profile along the sweep path; corresponds to Profile Twist > Specify Twist Value in the Sweep PropertyManager |
| swTwistControlFollowFirstSecondGuideCurves | 3 = The twist of the intermediate sections is determined by the vector from the first guide cruve to the second guide curve; the angle between the horizontal plane and the vector remains constant in the sketch planes of all of the intermediate sections; corresponds to Profile Twist > Follow First and Second Guide Curves in the Sweep PropertyManager (only valid if two guide curves are present) |
| swTwistControlFollowPath | 0 = Corresponds to Profile orientation > Follow Path in the Sweep PropertyManager; after specifying this option, use ISweepFeatureData::PathAlignmentType to specify path alignment options as defined in swTangencyType_e |
| swTwistControlFollowPathFirstGuideCurve | 2 = The twist of the intermediate sections is determined by the vector from the path to the first guide curve; the angle between the horizontal plane and the vector remains constant in the sketch planes of all of the intermediate sections; corresponds to Profile Twist > Follow Path and First Guide Curve in the Sweep PropertyManager (only valid if at least one guide curve is present) |
| swTwistControlKeepNormalConstant | 1 = Twists the section along the sweep path, keeping the section parallel to the beginning section as it twists along the path; corresponds to Profile orientation > Keep Normal Constant in the Sweep PropertyManager |
| swTwistControlNormalConstantTwistAlongPath | 9 = Defines the twist of the profile along the sweep path, keeping the section parallel to the beginning section as it twists along the path; corresponds to Profile orientation > Keep Normal Constant and Profile Twist > Specify Twist Value in the Sweep PropertyManager |
