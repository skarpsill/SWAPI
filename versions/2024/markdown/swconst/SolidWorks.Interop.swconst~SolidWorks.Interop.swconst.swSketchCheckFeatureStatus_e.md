# swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_e Enumeration

Statuses after checking to see if this sketch is valid for use in creating the specified feature

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Public Enum swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_e
   Inherits System.Enum
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_e
```

### C#

```csharp
public enum swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_e : System.Enum
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
public enum class swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_e : public System.Enum
```

## Members

| Member | Description |
| --- | --- |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_ClosedWantOpen | 15 = The contour is closed |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_ContourIntersectsCenterLine | 23 = The revolution contour cannot cross the centerline or touch it in an isolated point |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_CturXCtur | 12 = The sketch has intersecting contours |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_DisjCturs | 13 = The sketch contains disjoint contours |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_DoubleContainment | 16 = The sketch contains a doubly nested contour |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_EmptySketch | 5 |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_EntUnspecBad | 3 = The sketch contains a self-intersecting entity |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_EntXEnt | 1 = The sketch contains a self-intersecting contour |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_EntXSelf | 2 = The sketch contains a self-intersecting entity |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_ManyOpen | 9 = The sketch has more than one open contour |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_MixedContours | 11 = The sketch has both open and closed contours |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_MoreThanOneContour | 17 = The sketch contains more than one contour |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_NeedsAxis | 21 = The sketch should contain a centerline |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_NoOpen | 10 = The sketch has no more open contours |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_OK | 0 = No problems found, the sketch can be used to create the specified feature. |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_OneClosedContourExpected | 19 = The sketch should contain a single closed contour |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_OneOpenContourExpected | 18 = The sketch should contain a single open contour |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_OpenOrUnclear | 22 = Selected contours are open or ambiguous |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_OpenWantClosed | 14 = The contour is open |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_ThreeEnts | 4 = The sketch cannot be used for a feature because an endpoint is wrongly shared by multiple entities |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_UnknownError | -1 = Unknown error |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_WantSingleOpenOrMultiClosedDisjoint | 20 = The sketch should contain either one open contour or multiple closed disjoint contours |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_WrongManyContours | 7 = The sketch has more than one contour |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_WrongOpen | 6 = The sketch contains an open contour |
| swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_ZeroLengthEnt | 8 = The sketch contains a zero-length entity |
