# Create Auto Route Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to connect two points using the Auto Route interface.

```vb
'----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
 ' 1. In SOLIDWORKS, click Tools > Add-Ins > SOLIDWORKS Routing.
 ' 2. In the IDE, right-click the project, select Add Reference,
 '      browse  install_dir\api\redist, and click
 '    SolidWorks.Interop.SWRoutingLib.dll).
 ' 3. In Tools > Options > System Options > Routing > Routing File Locations,
 '    add the locations of your SOLIDWORKS routing files.
 ' 4. Open a routing assembly that contains Route1 and two sketch points.
 ' 5. Modify the swModel.Extension.SelectByID2 parameters to select two sketch
 '    points through which to auto route.
 ' 6. Select the assembly that contains Route1 in the FeatureManager design tree.
 ' 7. Open an Immediate Window.
 '
 ' Postconditions: Auto Route connects the selected sketch points.
 '
 ' NOTE: Because the assembly is used elsewhere, do not save changes.
