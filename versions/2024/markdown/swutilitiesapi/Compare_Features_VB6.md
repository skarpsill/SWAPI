# Compare Features Example (VBA)

This example shows how to compare the solid features between the original
and modified parts using the SOLIDWORKS Utilities API.

```
'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Add the SOLIDWORKS Utilities as an add-in
'    (in SOLIDWORKS, click Tools > Add-Ins > SOLIDWORKS Utilities).
' 2. Add the SOLIDWORKS Utilities type library as a reference
'    (in the SOLIDWORKS Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications IDE, click
'    Tools > References > SolidWorks Utilities <version> Type Library).
' 3. Verify that the specified parts exist.
' 4. Verify that C:\test\ exists.
'
' Postconditions:
'
' 1. Creates a solid feature comparison report for the two parts,
'    C:\test\Report\gtReportIndex.htm.
' 2. Examine the graphics area and C:\test\Report\gtReportIndex.htm.
'
' NOTE: Because the parts are used elsewhere, do not save changes.
