# RunThinAnalysis2 Method (IThicknessAnalysis)

Runs a thickness analysis, shows the thin regions, and generates a report.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function RunThinAnalysis2( _
   ByVal targetthickness As System.Double, _
   ByVal resolution As System.Integer, _
   ByVal lResultOptions As System.Integer, _
   ByVal reportname As System.String, _
   ByVal vtAddToBinderOption As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal vtSaveResultsInEdwg As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal vtOverwrite As System.Boolean _
) As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IThicknessAnalysis
Dim targetthickness As System.Double
Dim resolution As System.Integer
Dim lResultOptions As System.Integer
Dim reportname As System.String
Dim vtAddToBinderOption As System.Boolean
Dim vtSaveResultsInEdwg As System.Boolean
Dim vtOverwrite As System.Boolean
Dim value As System.Integer

value = instance.RunThinAnalysis2(targetthickness, resolution, lResultOptions, reportname, vtAddToBinderOption, vtSaveResultsInEdwg, vtOverwrite)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int RunThinAnalysis2(
   System.double targetthickness,
   System.int resolution,
   System.int lResultOptions,
   System.string reportname,
   System.bool vtAddToBinderOption,
   System.bool vtSaveResultsInEdwg,
   System.bool vtOverwrite
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.int RunThinAnalysis2(
   System.double targetthickness,
   System.int resolution,
   System.int lResultOptions,
   System.String^ reportname,
   System.bool vtAddToBinderOption,
   System.bool vtSaveResultsInEdwg,
   System.bool vtOverwrite
)
```

### Parameters

- `targetthickness`: Target thickness in meters
- `resolution`: Resolution as defined in

[gttckResolutionOptions_e](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.gtswutilities~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.gtswutilities.gttckResolutionOptions_e.html)
- `lResultOptions`: True to disregard corners sharp corners, false to notParamDesc
- `reportname`: Path to which to save the results report
- `vtAddToBinderOption`: True to add the results report to the Design Binder, false to not
- `vtSaveResultsInEdwg`: True to save results in eDrawings, false to not
- `vtOverwrite`: True to overwrite an existing results report of the same name, false to not

### Return Value

Error as defined in

[gtError_e](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.gtswutilities~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.gtswutilities.gtError_e.html)

## VBA Syntax

## Remarks

| If there are any... | Then the analysis is run on... |
| --- | --- |
| Selected faces | Only those faces |
| Selected faces that belong to multiple solid bodies | Only on the selected faces of the body selected by IThicknessAnalysys::SetThicknessAnalysisBody |
