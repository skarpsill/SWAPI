```vb
Dim instance As IFeaturePaint
```

### C#

```

## VBA Syntax

See

[IFeaturePaint](ms-its:swutilitiesapivb6.chm::/swutilities~IFeaturePaint.html)

.

## Remarks

For example, you can specify a boss-extrude on one part and apply its parameters (such as depth) to another boss-extrude on a different part.

You can also specify two different features and apply feature parameters. For example, specify that a sweep feature apply its parameters (such as color and advanced color properties) to a dome feature.
