)
```

)
```

### Parameters

- `bsUserName`: User name of user created in the SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional User Manager
- `bsPasswd`: Password for bsUserName
- `bsVaultName`: Vault name

## Remarks

If your application is custom (i.e., it is not supplied or supported by SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional) and your application:

- logs into SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional

  - or -
- logs into a vault view

  - or -
- directly accesses a vault database

when the same user is not already logged into a local view, you must first call[IEdmVault13::LoginEx](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmVault13~LoginEx.html)or[IEdmVault5::LoginAuto](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmVault5~LoginAuto.html)to comply with the[SOLIDWORKS End User License Agreement (EULA)](http://www.solidworks.com/sw/eula.htm). Call IEdmVault13::LoginEx or IEdmVault5::LoginAuto before calling this method to ensure that licenses are properly consumed by your application.

Call IEdmVault5::LoginAuto to log in as a user already logged into a vault view through File Explorer or into a vault through the SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional client software. You do not need to specify a username and password when you call IEdmVault5::LoginAuto to share a license with the already logged-in user.

[Return codes:](ReturnCodes.htm)

- E_EDM_ALREADY_LOGGED_IN: You are already logged into this vault.
- E_EDM_LOGIN_FAILED: You entered an invalid user name or password.
- E_EDM_CANT_OPEN_DATABASE: The database could not be opened.
