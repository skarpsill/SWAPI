# AddFolder Method (IEdmFolder5)

Creates a subfolder in this folder.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic

```vb
Function AddFolder( _
   ByVal lParentWnd As System.Integer, _
   ByVal bsFolderName As System.String, _
   Optional ByVal poData As EdmFolderData _
) As IEdmFolder5
```

### C#

```csharp
IEdmFolder5 AddFolder(
   System.int lParentWnd,
   System.string bsFolderName,
   EdmFolderData poData
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
IEdmFolder5^ AddFolder(
   System.int lParentWnd,
   System.String^ bsFolderName,
   EdmFolderData^ poData
)
```

### Parameters

- `lParentWnd`: Parent window handle
- `bsFolderName`: Name of the new folder
- `poData`: [IEdmFolderData5](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmFolderData5.html)

; optional additional data (see

Remarks

)

### Return Value

[IEdmFolder5](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmFolder5.html)

## Examples

[Add Folder (VB.NET)](Add_Folder_Example_VBNET.htm)

[Add Folder (C#)](Add_Folder_Example_CSharp.htm)

## Remarks

To create all the folders in a path in one operation, call[IEdmFolder5::CreateFolderPath](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmFolder5~CreateFolderPath.html).

To add more than one folder, use[IEdmBatchAddFolders](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmBatchAddFolders.html)to add them all at once, which is much more efficient than using this method, which adds folders only one at a time.

If poData is null, the user rights and file data card for the new folder are inherited from the parent folder.

C++ users not using smart-pointer wrapper functions must release the returned pointer to IEdmFolder5.

[Return codes](ReturnCodes.htm):

- S_OK: The method successfully executed.
- E_EDM_INVALID_NAME: The folder name contained invalid characters.
- E_EDM_COULD_NOT_CREATE_LOCAL_FOLDER: Could not create the new folder in the local disk cache.
- E_EDM_NAME_ALREADY_EXISTS: There is already a file or folder with the specified name in this folder.
- E_EDM_FOLDER_NOT_FOUND: This folder has been deleted.
- E_EDM_PERMISSION_DENIED: The user lacks permission to create sub-folders here.
- E_EDM_OPERATION_REFUSED_BY_PLUGIN: The operation was not permitted by one of the installed

  [EdmCmdData](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmdData.html)

  .EdmCmd_PreAddFolder hooks.
