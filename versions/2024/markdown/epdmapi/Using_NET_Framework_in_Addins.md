# Using .NET Framework in Add-in Applications

Many versions of .NET Framework may be installed with your Windows operating
system or Visual Studio. See[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb822049(v=vs.110).aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb822049(v=vs.110).aspx).

SOLIDWORKS
PDM Professional supports one or more versions of .NET Framework.

| SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional versions... | Support
.NET Framework... |
| --- | --- |
| 2013 and
later | 4 .0 and later |
| 2009 - 2012 | 3.5, 3.0, and 2.0 |
| 2008 and
earlier | 2.0 |

If using .NET Framework 4.0
or later, prevent failures when calling methods that pass arrays of structures by:

1. Opening the project in Visual Studio.
2. Right-clicking

  References > EPDM.Interop.epdm

  in the Solution Explorer
  and selecting

  Properties

  .
3. Setting

  Embed Interop Types

  to

  False

  in
  Properties.
4. Right-clicking

  References > EPDM.Interop.EPDMResultCode

  in the Solution Explorer
  and selecting

  Properties

  .
5. Setting

  Embed Interop Types

  to

  False

  in
  Properties.
6. Initializing arrays of structures in your code to:

  - VB.NET:

    Nothing
  - C#:

    null

If your SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 2012 or earlier version add-in application
is compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio and a .NET Framework version
other than version 2.0, then SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional may show the following message when you
try to load the
add-in:

“The Archive Server could not open the Windows Registry.”

- C# or VB.NET

  To
  solve this problem, try changing your add-in project’s target framework to .NET
  Framework 2.0:

1. Right-click the project in the

  Solution Explorer

  .
2. Select

  Properties

  .
3. Click

  Compile > Advanced Compile Options

  .
4. Select .NET Framework 2.0.
5. Click

  OK

  .

After changing your project’s target framework to .NET Framework 2.0, you might
no longer be able to reference the SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional`nnnn`Type Library (**EdmInterface.dll**), because Visual Studio created the DLL using the latest version of .NET Framework,
but you just changed the
project to target an earlier version of .NET Framework (2.0). If you encounter this
problem, you can generate a compatible SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional primary interop
assembly by using the Microsoft's Type Library Importer (**TlbImp.exe)**that is
included in an earlier
version of the Microsoft .NET Framework SDK.

1. Download and install a version of .NET Framework SDK that is
  compatible with your add-in project's version.
2. Open a Windows Command Prompt.
3. Navigate to

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v

  x.x

  \Bin

  in which the earlier .NET Framework version of

  TlbImp.exe

  is
  installed.
4. Type

  TlbImp.exe

  install_dir

  \EdmInterface.dll /sysarray /out:Interop.EdmLib.dll /namespace:EdmLib.
5. Modify all add-in examples in this help file to use
  the new interop ssembly.

- C++

  This problem can occur at runtime if the add-in failed to register its DLL
  during the build process. To solve this problem, ensure that your add-in
  registers the DLL:

  1. Open your C++ add-in project.
  2. Right-click the project in the

    Solution Explorer

    .
  3. Select

    Properties

    .
  4. Click

    Linker > Input

    .
  5. Configure

    Module Definition File

    to point to the add-in's

    project_name

    .def

    .
  6. Save the project.
  7. Click

    Build > Clean Solution

    .
  8. Click

    Build > Build Solution

    .
