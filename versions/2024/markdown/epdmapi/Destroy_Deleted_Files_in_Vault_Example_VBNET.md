# Destroy Deleted Files in Vault Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to create an application that displays a form in which
a user can select the vault in whose root
folder and subfolders all deleted files will be permanently destroyed. The user must have permission to delete
files.

**NOTE**: If using the primary interop assembly
provided with SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional, see[Using .NET Framework 4.0 in
Stand-alone Applications](Using_NET_Framework_in_Applications.htm).

IMPORTANT:Do not recreate and run this
example if you do not want to destroy all deleted files in the root folder and
subfolders in the selected vault. Instead, SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional suggests
that you review the code to understand how you can programmatically destroy
deleted files in the root folder and subfolders of a vault.

```vb
'----------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
'  1. Start Microsoft Visual Studio.
'  2. Click File > New > Project > Visual Basic > Windows Forms Application.
'  3. Type the name of your project in Name.
'  4. Click the Browse button and browse to the folder where to create the project.
'  5. Click OK.
'  6. Replace the code in Form1.vb with this code.
 '  7. Replace the code in Form1.Designer.vb with  this code.
'  8.  Add EPDM.Interop.epdm.dll as a reference (right-click the project
 '     name in the Solution Explorer, click Add Reference, click
 '     Framework in the left-side panel, browse to the top folder of your
 '     SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional installation, locate and click
 '     EPDM.Interop.epdm.dll, click Open, click  Add, and click Close).
 '  9. Right-click EPDM.Interop.epdm in References, click Properties, and set
 '     Embed Interop Types to False to handle methods that pass arrays of
 '     structures.
' 10. Switch back to Form1.vb code window.
' 11. Delete one or more checked-in files in the root folder of your vault.
' 12. Click Debug > Start Debugging or press F5.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 '  1. Displays the Destroy Deleted Files dialog.
 '  2. Select a vault.
 '  3. Optionally select the Include all subfolders check box.
 '  4. Click the Destroy deleted files button.
 '     A message box pops up informing you that:
 '     * No deleted files were found to destroy.
 '       - or -
 '     * The deleted files were destroyed.
 '  5. Click OK in the message box.
 '  6. Close the Destroy Deleted Files dialog.
