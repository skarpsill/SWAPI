# Transform Parts and Bodies

A transform ([eDTransform3d](../eDTransform3d/eDTransform3d_Class.htm))
contains rotation matrix ([eDMatrix3d](../eDMatrix3d/eDMatrix3d_Class.htm)),
translation vector ([eDPt3d](../eDPt3d/eDPt3d_Class.htm)),
scale value, and Boolean values that describe other properties of the
transform.

Within a part or an assembly, set part transforms with eDTransform3d
objects. Within a part, set body transforms with eDTransform3d objects
before or after adding them to parts. All pointers remain valid.
