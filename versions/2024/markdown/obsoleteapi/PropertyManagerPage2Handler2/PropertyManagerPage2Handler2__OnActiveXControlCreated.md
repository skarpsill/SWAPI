# PropertyManagerPage2Handler2::OnActiveXControlCreated

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by[PropertyManagerPage2Handler3::OnActiveXControlCreated](../PropertyManagerPage2Handler3/PropertyManagerPage2Handler3__OnActiveXControlCreated.htm).

Description

This method is called when
an attempt to create an ActiveX control on the PropertyManager occurs.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = PropertyManagerPage2Handler2.OnActiveXControlCreated
( Id, Status )

(Table)=========================================================

| Input: | (long) Id | ID of this ActiveX control |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT_BOOL) Status | TRUE if the ActiveX control creation was successful, FALSE if not |
| Output: | (long) retval | Action to take if the creation of the ActiveX control failed as defined
in swHandleActiveXCreationFailure (see Remarks ) |

Syntax (COM)

status = PropertyManagerPage2Handler2->OnActiveXControlCreated
( Id, Status, &retval )

Parameters Table Start

(Table)=========================================================

| Input: | (long) Id | ID of this ActiveX control |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT_BOOL) Status | TRUE if the creation of the ActiveX control was successful, FALSE if
not |
| Output: | (long) retval | Action to take if the creation of the ActiveX control failed as defined
in swHandleActiveXCreationFailure (see Remarks ) |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S_OK if successful |

Remarks

When the ActiveX control is created, the program
creating the PropertyManager page should receive notification from this
handler. Specify one of the available enumerators for this handler's retval
argument:

- swHandleActiveXCreationFailure_Cancel.
  Continue creating the DVE page without the ActiveX control. This is the
  default.
- swHandleActiveXCreationFailure_Retry.
  Try to create the ActiveX control again. You can reuse the PropertyManagerPageActiveX::SetClass
  method to change the control ID or the license key to perhaps use another
  similar control or another version of the control, and then specify swHandleActiveXCreationFailure_Retry.
  Avoid an endless loop situation.
- swHandleActiveXCreationFailure_Continue.
  Cancel creating PropertyManager page. For example, it might be that the
  PropertyManager page is useless without the control, so the calling add-in
  might want to quit and handle the situation on its own.

Do not call PropertyManagerPageActiveX::GetControl
to get the interface object for this ActiveX control.

You cannot get a reference to the ActiveX
control inside this event handler, because the page is notkadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}displayed
when this notification is sent. You can only get the reference to the
control after the PropertyManager page is displayed.
