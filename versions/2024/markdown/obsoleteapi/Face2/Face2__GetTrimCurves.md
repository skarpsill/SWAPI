Not available.

Syntax (COM)

status = Face2->GetTrimCurves ( wantCubic, &retval
)

Parameters Table Start

(Table)=========================================================

| Input: | (VARIANT_BOOL) wantCubic | TRUE if the trim curves are to be cubic, FALSE if not |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray (see Remarks ) |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method returns an array containing the definition
of all of the entities that describe a trimmed face. The data is arranged
in collections of surface curves (curves defined in the 2D parametric
space of the surface, or SP curves) organized into loops (closed composite
curves).

All SP curves are returned as b-splines. To control the tolerance of
the SP curves, use[Modeler::SetTolerances](../Modeler/Modeler__SetTolerances.htm).

The surface and trim curve parameterization returned by this method
might be different from the parameterization returned by other methods,
such as[Face::GetUVBounds](../Face/Face__GetUVBounds.htm),
Surface::Parameterization,[Edge::GetCurveParams](../Edge/Edge__GetCurveParams.htm),
and so on.

If you set wantCubic to TRUE, then this method returns the underlying
Bsurface definition. If you want to use the Bsurface in combination with
its trim curves, set wantCubic=TRUE because it provides better alignment
of the trim curves with the Bsurface because they are generated at the
same time.

Each face typically has at least one outer loop and zero or more inner
loops. Outer loops define the periphery of the face; inner loops define
holes in the face. Outer loops are returned before inner loops if possible.
To be certain, use Loop2::IsOuter.

#### Periodic Faces

Periodic faces present many obstacles in translation. As a general rule,
it is best to chop up all periodic surfaces by making a call to Body::GetProcessedBody.
This method returns a new body to the caller with periodic faces chopped
up into multiple faces. Processing this new body, instead of the original
body, avoids many of the pitfalls associated with periodics.

If this face is periodic and crosses the seam (0 and 360° location), then this method splits the face into more than one trimmed
surface to return this set of data. The first time that this method is
called on any face, it returns data for the first trimmed surface on the
face. Each subsequent call to this method on the same face returns data
for the next trimmed surface, if one exists. See the packedDouble8 parameter to determine the number of surfaces for this face.

To avoid returning multiple surfaces per face, process the body returned
from Body::GetProcessedBody.

In addition, using the Body object returned from Body::GetProcessedBody
usually prevents returning multiple outer loops when it encounters certain
periodic surfaces. In other words, it can prevent generating multiple
faces (each with an outer loop) for a particular periodic surface.

#### Edges

If your program calls both[Face::GetEdges](../Face/Face__GetEdges.htm)and this method or to both[Face::EnumEdges](../Face/Face__EnumEdges.htm)and this method, thenthis method
stores a temporary buffer containing the edges for this face. If this
temporary buffer exists, then calls to Face::GetEdges or Face::EnumEdges
access the buffer. This is beneficial if you are attempting to align the
trim curves of the face with their corresponding Edges.

If your call to Face::GetEdges or
Face::EnumEdges is made immediately following your call to this method,
then the order of the trim curves aligns with the order of the edges.
However, if you are processing all the trimcurves and then processing
all the edges, your first call to access the edges uses the temporary
buffer of edges generated in your last call to this method. Because your
last call to this method and your current call to get the edges were probably
made from different faces, you will see a mismatch of data. This mismatch
of data may been seen when Face::GetEdgeCount does not match the SafeArray
size from Face::GetEdges or it may be seen when the edge data does not
match the face being examined. Therefore, calls to Face::GetEdges or Face::EnumEdges
should be made in the same loop and immediately following your call to
Face::GetEdges. The temporary buffer of edges is destroyed after each
call to Face::GetEdges or Face::EnumEdges.

There might not be a corresponding edge for each trim curve. This is
true for periodic surfaces for which no edge exists along the seam (0
and 360° location), yet this method returns a trim curve. You can detect this situation
by comparing the number of edges on the face, Face::GetEdgeCount , with the number of trim (SP) curves on the face, PackedDouble1 .

To force edge generation along the seam
of a periodic surface, use Body::GetProcessedBody. This method creates
a copy of the body with faces and surfaces chopped up. However, there
are still certain situations (poles of a surface, cusps on a surface,
and so on) in which this method returns a trim curve where no edge exists.
In this situation, the list of edges returned from Face::GetEdges or Face::EnumEdges
does not align with the list of trim curves. Again, you can detect this
by comparing the value returned by Face::GetEdgeCount withPackedDouble1, but you need to handle matching the edges with their corresponding trim
curve.

#### Return Values

The data is returned in a large array of doubles. Integer data is packed
among the doubles in pairs.

The format offaceData[]
is as follows:

[packedDouble1, packedDouble2[ ], packedDouble3[
], knotValues[ ], ctrlPointCoords[ ], packedDouble8]

(Table)=========================================================

| packedDouble1 | An integer pair containing number of loops and total number of SP curves
(trim curves). The length of any edge list generated immediately after
a call to GetTrimCurves2 will
be equal to the number of SP curves. |
| --- | --- |
| packedDouble2[ ] | Series of integer pairs containing the number of SP curves in each loop;
the first integer in each pair represents the number of curves in the
odd loops, the second represents the even. The total number of integer
pairs here is half the number of loops, rounded up |
| packedDouble3[ ] | For each SP curve, a set of two integer pairs. The first contains the
order of the curve and a boolean indicating if it is periodic. If the
curve is periodic, it will be clamped (that is, knots of multiplicity
= order will exist at each end of the curve). The second contains the
dimension of the curve and the number of control points in it. If the
dimension is 2, the curve is non-rational; if the dimension is 3 the curve
is rational. |
| knotValues[ ] | Array of doubles containing the knot values for all the SP curves in
order. The number of knots for each curve is equal to the order of the
curve plus the number of control points. |
| ctrlPointCoords[ ] | Array of doubles containing the coordinates of the control points for
all the SP curves in order. These are given as a sequence of (U,V) pairs
if non-rational, and (U,V,W) triples if rational, where W is the homogeneous
coordinate known as the weight. |
| packedDouble8 | Integer pair as follows: the first integer is the total number of trimmed
surfaces being output for the given face (the modeler sometimes outputs
more than one trimmed surface for a face). The second integer indicates
the index of the current trimmed surface being output. All the data in
the faceData [] array is for the
current trimmed surface. Therefore, if packedDouble8 says there are two trim surfaces, you should use the same Face pointer
and call GetTrimCurves2 again
to get the data for the second trim surface. |

If b-splines were requested
(WantCubic = TRUE), then the underlying Bsurface is also returned. The
faceData[ ] array would be as follows:

[packedDouble1, packedDouble2[ ], packedDouble3[
], knotValues[ ], ctrlPointCoords[ ], packedDouble4, packedDouble5, packedDouble6,
packedDouble7, surfaceKnotValuesU[ ], surfaceKnotValuesV[ ], surfaceCtrlPointCoords[
], packedDouble8]

(Table)=========================================================

| packedDouble1 | See previous definition. |
| --- | --- |
| packedDouble2[ ] | See previous definition. |
| packedDouble3[ ] | See previous definition. |
| knotValues[ ] | See previous definition. |
| ctrlPointCoords[ ] | SSee previous definition. |
| packedDouble4 | Integer pair containing the dimension of the surface (3 is non-rational
and 4 is rational). The second member of the pair is not used and contains
a 0. |
| PackedDouble5 | Integer pair containing the U-order and the V-order of the surface. |
| PackedDouble6 | Integer pair containing the number of control points in U and the number
of control points in V |
| packedDouble7 | Integer pair containing BOOLEANs indicating if the surface is periodic
in U and in V. If the surface is periodic, it will be clamped (that is,
knots of multiplicity = order will exist at each end of the surface). |
| surfaceKnotValuesU[ ] | Array of doubles containing the knot values in U for the surface. The
number of knots in U is equal to the order in U plus the number of control
points in U. |
| surfaceKnotValuesV[ ] | Array of doubles containing the knot values in V as above for U. |
| surfaceCtrlPointCoords[ ] | Array of doubles containing the coordinates of the control points for
the surface. These are given as a sequence of (X,Y,Z) triples if non-rational,
and (X,Y,Z,W) tuples if rational, where W is the homogeneous coordinate
known as the weight. The coordinates are given in row-wise order (V varying
most quickly). |
| packedDouble8 | See previous definition. |
