# SldWorks::OpenDocSilent

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by[SldWorks::OpenDoc2](SldWorks__OpenDoc3.htm).

Description

This method opens an existing document and returns a pointer to the
document object. The display of dialog boxes is suppressed.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = SldWorks.OpenDocSilent ( Name,
Type, &Errors )

(Table)=========================================================

| Input: | (BSTR) Name | Name of document or full path, if not current directory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) Type | Type of document as defined by swDocumentTypes_e |
| Output: | (long) Errors | Error code as defined by swFileLoadError_e |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to dispatch object, the document, or NULL if the operation fails |

Syntax (COM)

status = SldWorks->IOpenDocSilent
( Name, Type, &Errors, &retval )

(Table)=========================================================

| Input: | (BSTR) Name | Name of document or full path, if not current directory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) Type | Type of document as defined by swDocumentTypes_e |
| Output: | (long) Errors | Error code as defined by swFileLoadError_e |
| Output: | (LPMODELDOC) retval | Pointer to the document or NULL if the operation fails |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method is identical to SldWorks::OpenDoc except that dialog boxes
are suppressed. The error code returned is a bitwise OR of the error codes
that were generated in opening the document. The masks to check against
are the values of the enumerator swFileLoadError_e.

Calling SldWorks::OpenDoc
or SldWorks::OpenDocSilent does not change thecurrent
working directoryto that of the opened file; whereas, interactively
using the File Open dialog box does. This may affect documents with references.

When opening a parent document (assembly, drawing, and so on.), SolidWorks
also opens any additional documents that are referenced in the parent
document (parts, subassemblies, and so on). SolidWorks follows certain
rules in trying to locate its referenced documents. If explicit Search
Folders have not been set usingTools,
Options, System Options, External References, then the first place
SolidWorks looks for the referenced documents is in the current working
directory. If SolidWorks finds the referenced file in the current working
directory, then it loads it from that directory.

Interactively performing File Open immediately sets the current working
directory to that of the document being opened. However, SldWorks::OpenDoc
and SldWorks::OpenDocSilent do not set the current working directory for
SolidWorks. Because the user may have interactively opened files from
some random directory, you cannot be certain that the current working
directory is pointing to the desired location. This may affect the referenced
documents that get loaded when using any of the SldWorks::OpenDocnmethods versus performing File Open
interactively. Because of this, you may want to consider setting the current
working directory before calling any of the SldWorks::OpenDocnmethods. This can be done using SldWorks::SetCurrentWorkingDirectory.
To mimic the behavior of the File Open dialog, set the current working
directory to that of the file being opened.

When opening files that contain references, you may also want to consider
the current Search Folder settings because this may affect the references
that get loaded. This can be done programmatically using SldWorks::GetSearchFolders
and SldWorks::SetSearchFolders. If Search Folders are currently in use,
SolidWorks looks for references in the Search Folders before trying to
locate references in the current working directory.

SldWorks::OpenDocSilent will not activate and display the document if
the file is already open in memory in an assembly or drawing. However,
SldWorks::OpenDocSilent should return a valid ModelDoc pointer that is
usable with functions that do not require a document to be displayed.
If you want, SldWorks::ActivateDoc will activate and display the document.
Because calling SldWorks::OpenDocSilent will not activate nor display
the file, calling SldWorks::ActiveDoc will not return a pointer to this
document.

To open a library feature part, use swDocPART for the Type argument.

To open foreign files (IGES, STEP, and so on) use SldWorks::LoadFile2.
