# ModelDoc::InsertCutSwept4

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by[ModelDoc2::InsertCutSwept4](../ModelDoc2/ModelDoc2__InsertCutSwept4.htm).

Description

This method inserts a swept cut from the selected profile and the selected
sweep curves.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc.InsertCutSwept4 ( propagate, alignment,
twistCtrlOption, keepTangency, forceNonRational, startMatchingType, endMatchingType,
isThinBody, thickness1, thickness2, thinType )

(Table)=========================================================

| Input: | (BOOL) propagate | If TRUE, then the swept cut will propagate to the next edge,FALSE will
cause the swept cut to occur only on the selected edge; to propagate to
the next edge, the next edge must be tangent to the current edge |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BOOL) alignment | If the curve used to sweep goes from on face to another, or from one
edge to another, passing TRUE will cause the sweep to cut completely through
the end faces of the cut; if you choose FALSE, then the swept cut will
begin and end perpendicular to the sweep curve and, therefore, may not
break through the two end faces of the body being cut |  |
| Input: | (short) twistCtrlOption | Twist control options |  |
| Input: | (BOOL) keepTangency | Follow path |  |
| Input: | (BOOL) forceNonRational | Keep constant normal |  |
| Input: | (short) startMatchingType | Tangency type |  |
| Input: | (short) endMatchingType | Tangency type |  |
| Input: | (BOOL) isThinBody | TRUE if this feature is a thin body, FALSE otherwise |  |
| Input: | (double) thickness1 | Thickness value for the first direction |  |
| Input: | (double) thickness2 | Thickness value for the second direction |  |
| Input: | (short) thinType | TRUE if this feature is a thin feature, FALSE
otherwise |  |

Syntax (COM)

| Input: | (short) thinType | TRUE if this feature is a thin feature, FALSE
otherwise |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S_OK if successful |

Remarks

Use SelectByMark and AndSelectByMark to select the profile and sweep
curves. The mark for the profile selection should be a 1, while the mark
for the sweep path should be 4. If guide curve selection is provided,
the SelectByMark mark should be 2.

The twistCtrlOption argument may take one of the following values:

0 = Follow path

1 = Keep constant normal

2 = Follow path and first guide curve

3 = Follow first and second guide curve

The tangency
type arguments may take the following values:

0 - none

1 - tangent to
the normal of the profile

2 - tangent to
a selected vector

3 - tangency to
all the adjacent faces sharing an edge with the start profile

4 - tangent to
some of the selected faces sharing an edge with the start profile (not
currently available)
