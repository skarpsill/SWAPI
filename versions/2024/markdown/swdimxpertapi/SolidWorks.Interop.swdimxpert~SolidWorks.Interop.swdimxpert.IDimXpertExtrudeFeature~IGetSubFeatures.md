## Remarks

This method returns all sub-features of this extrude feature. All of the sub-features returned by this method do not appear on the DimXpertManager tab of the Management Panel. Functional geometry sub-features such as planes and cylinders that represent each individual face of a part are for internal use only. These sub-features do not appear in the DimXpertManager tree. However, manufacturing sub-features that are significant for downstream machining and inspection do appear in the DimXpertManager tree.

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/Overview/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

Before calling this method, call[IDimXpertExtrudeFeature::GetSubFeatureCount](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swdimxpert~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swdimxpert.IDimXpertExtrudeFeature~GetSubFeatureCount.html)to get the value for the Count parameter.
