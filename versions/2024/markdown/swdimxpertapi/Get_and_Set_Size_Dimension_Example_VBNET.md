# Get and Set Size Dimension Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to get
and set DimXpert compound width features.

```vb
 '------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
 ' 1. Open public_documents\samples\tutorial\dimxpert\bracket_ads_plusminus.sldprt.
 ' 2. Select an edge.
 ' 3. Open the Immediate window.
 ' 4. Ensure that the latest SOLIDWORKS DimXpert interop assembly is referenced:
 '    a. Right-click the project in Project Explorer.
 '    b. Select Add Reference.
 '    c. Click the Browse tab.
 '    d. Find and select install_dir\api\redist\swdimxpert.dll.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1. Inspect the Immediate Window.
 ' 2. Observe the Width1 feature and the Width2 size dimension on the
 '    DimXpertManager tab.
 '
 ' NOTE: Because this part is used elsewhere, do not save changes.
