# CombinedTime Property (ICostFeature)

Gets or sets the time for this Costing feature or operation, including the combined times of Costing child features and operations.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property CombinedTime As System.Double
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICostFeature
Dim value As System.Double

instance.CombinedTime = value

value = instance.CombinedTime
```

### C#

```csharp
System.double CombinedTime {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.double CombinedTime {
   System.double get();
   void set (    System.double value);
}
```

### Property Value

Time for this Costing feature or operation, including the combined times of Costing child features and operations

## VBA Syntax

See

[CostFeature::CombinedTime](swcostingapivb6.chm::/SldCostingAPI~CostFeature~CombinedTime.html)

## Remarks

Setting this property is:

- equivalent to applying a cost override to this Costing feature.
- ignored if the Costing feature disallows applying a cost override. For example, sheet metal Costing features must always return a time of 0; thus, times for sheet metal Costing features cannot be overridden.
