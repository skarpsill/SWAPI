## Members

| Member | Description |
| --- | --- |
| swFileLoadWarning_AlreadyOpen | 128 or 0x80 = Warning appears because the document is already open. |
| swFileLoadWarning_AutomaticRepair | 262144 or 0x40000 = Warning appears that non-critical data in the document was automatically repaired. |
| swFileLoadWarning_BasePartNotLoaded | 64 or 0x40 = Warning appears because the document was defined in the context of another existing document that is not loaded. |
| swFileLoadWarning_ComponentMissingReferencedConfig | 32768 or 0x8000 = Warning appears if document is opened silently and swOpenDocOptions_AutoMissingConfig is specified. |
| swFileLoadWarning_CriticalDataRepair | 524288 or 0x80000 = Warning appears that critical data in the document was automatically repaired. |
| swFileLoadWarning_DimensionsReferencedIncorrectlyToModels | 16384 or 0x4000 = Warning appears because some dimensions are referenced to the models incorrectly; these dimensions are highlighted in red in the drawing. |
| swFileLoadWarning_DrawingANSIUpdate | 8 or 0x8 = Warning appears because radial dimension arrows now displayed outside when the dimension text is outside of the arc or circle. |
| swFileLoadWarning_DrawingSFSymbolConvert | 2048 or 0x800Warning appears asking the user if he or she wants to convert this drawing's surface finish symbols to the sizes specified in ANSI Y14.36M-1996 and ISO 1302-1978. |
| swFileLoadWarning_DrawingsOnlyRapidDraft | 256 or 0x100 = Warning appears because the only RapidDraft format conversion that can take place is a drawing document that is not Detached. |
| swFileLoadWarning_IdMismatch | 1 or 0x1 = Warning appears if the internal ID of the document does not match the internal ID saved with the referencing document. |
| swFileLoadWarning_InvisibleDoc_LinkedDesignTableUpdateFail | 65536 or 0x10000 = Warning issued because an attempt has been made to open an invisible document with a linked design table that was modified externally, and the design table cannot be updated because the document cannot be displayed; you must make the document visible to open it and update the design table. |
| swFileLoadWarning_MissingDesignTable | 131072 or 0x20000 = Warning appears because the design table is missing. |
| swFileLoadWarning_MissingExternalReferences | 1048576 or 0x100000 = Warning appears if one or more references are missing when loading a file. |
| swFileLoadWarning_ModelOutOfDate | 8192 or 0x2000 = Warning appears because some sheets contain drawing views that are out of date with their external models. |
| swFileLoadWarning_NeedsRegen | 32 or 0x20 = Warning appears because the document needs to be rebuilt. |
| swFileLoadWarning_ReadOnly | 2 or 0x2 = Warning appears because the document is read only. |
| swFileLoadWarning_RevolveDimTolerance | 4096 or 0x1000 = Warning appears because some of the tolerances of the revolved feature dimensions were created in SOLIDWORKS 99 or earlier and are not synchronized with their corresponding dimensions in the sketch. |
| swFileLoadWarning_SharingViolation | 4 or 0x4 = Warning appears if the document is being used by another user. |
| swFileLoadWarning_SheetScaleUpdate | 16 or 0x10 = Warning appears because SOLIDWORKS now applies the scale of the sheet to the sketch entities on the sheet; which means that the sheet looks the same but dimension values are scaled. |
| swFileLoadWarning_ViewMissingReferencedConfig | 1024 or 0x400 = Warning appears because a configuration that a drawing view is referencing no longer exists in the model (part or assembly); the active configuration is used. |
| swFileLoadWarning_ViewOnlyRestrictions | 512 or 0x200 = Warning appears because the document is view only and a configuration other than the default configuration is set. |
