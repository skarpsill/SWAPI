# Smart Pointers

Microsoft's Active Template Library (ATL) contains helper classes that
simplify the use of commonly used COM interfaces, components, and structures,
such as BSTRs, interface pointers, and variants.

The ATLCComPtrhelper class provides a smart pointer wrapper around COM interface pointers.
In this context, a smart pointer is a pointer that properly releases its
reference counts toward COM interfaces when it goes out of scope.

To instantiate the interface types that you will be accessing, you useCComPtrwith the interface type. For example:

CComPtr<ISldWorks> swApp

CComPtr<IModelDoc2> swModel

CComPtr<ISelectionMgr> swSelMgr

You can assign an interface pointer to your smart pointer in any of
the following ways:

- Call the smart pointer'sCoCreateInstancemember function.
- Pass the interface's raw interface pointer toCoCreateInstance.
- Call the smart pointer'sAttachmember function to assign a previously created interface pointer to the
  smart pointer. This does not cause the smart pointer to call the smart
  pointer'sAddReffunction through the new interface pointer.
- Simple assignment through the smart pointer's
  assignment operator causes the smart pointer to callAddRefthrough the new interface pointer.

Calling the smart pointer'sCoCreateInstancemember function is the simplest way to create a new interface pointer.
For example, to attach to the currently running instance of thesldworks.exeCOM server on your local
computer, use:

hres = swApp.CoCreateInstance(__uuidof(SldWorks),
NULL, CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER);

Like most other smart pointers,CComPtroverrides C++ operators to make the smart pointers act like normal C++
pointers.

To set a smart pointer to the value of a pointer returned from a function,
you can use the&operator, which works just like a non-smart pointer. If you need to decrement
a reference count, use the smart pointer'sReleasemember function.

To use ATL helper classes in your program, includeatlbase.hinstdafx.h.For an example of
using smart pointers, see[Access
Assembly Example (C++ COM)](sldworksAPI.chm::/Access_Assembly_Example_CPlusPlus_COM.htm).
