# Partition Rollback and API Handles

Partition rollback, introduced in SOLIDWORKS 2003, has changed the way
that SOLIDWORKS caches bodies.

(Table)=========================================================

| Before partition rollback: | The FeatureManager design tree and bodies were cached. Cached bodies
remained valid even if a model was rolled back to a state where one or
more bodies had not yet been created, because the SOLIDWORKS API was able
to get hold of the cached bodies. |
| --- | --- |
| With the introduction of partition rollback: | Bodies are no longer cached. Thus, the SOLIDWORKS API handle is not
valid after a model is rolled back to a state where one or more bodies
have not yet been created. |
