# Line Attributes for View::GetPolyLinesAndCurves

## Line Attributes for IView::GetPolyLinesAndCurves

- LineColor=
  polyline color. This value is determined either by the explicitly set
  value or by the layer that the polyline is on.
- LineStyle=
  value combines polyline font and weight information. This value can be
  used as an input to GetLineFontInfo and GetLineFontName. If this value
  is -1, then the user has probably modified the line display manually in
  the drawing, and you should use the LineFont and LineWeight return values
  to recreate the exact polyline style.
- LineFont=
  value is used for polyline font information. This value can be used as
  an input to the GetLineFontInfo2 and GetLineFontName2 functions. This
  value will only be valid if LineStyle is -1.
- LineWeight=
  polyline weight where Thin = 0.0, Normal = 1.0, Thick = 2.0. This value
  will only be valid if LineStyle is -1.
- LayerID=
  integer value indicating which layer holds this polyline. The ILayer object
  can be obtained by passing this integer value to ILayerMgr::GetLayerById.
- LayerOverride=
  integer with bit flags set to determine which properties, if any, have
  been overridden with respect to the layer default properties. If a bit
  flag is set, then the corresponding property or has been overridden.
  The bit flags are: color = 0x1, style = 0x2, and width = 0x4. Therefore,
  if LayerOverride is 3, then LineColor and LineStyle override the default color
  and style of the layer.
