# View::GetDimensionInfo4

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by View::GetDimensionInfo5 .

Description

The method gets all the dimension information in the view. All values
returned are in meters.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = View.GetDimensionInfo4 ( )

(Table)=========================================================

| Return: | (VARIANT)retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray containing the dimension information |
| --- | --- | --- |

Syntax (COM)

status = View->IGetDimensionInfo4
( retval )

(Table)=========================================================

| Output: | (double*)retval | pointer to an array of doubles containing the dimension information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S_OK if successful |

Remarks

For COM implementation, use View::GetDimensionCount
to determine the overall size of the array needed. The maximum number
of doubles contained in the array will be (1 +dimensionCount* 51).

The data returned is an array of doubles as follows:

[dimensionCount,[dimensionType,
LineStyleIndex, LineWidth, Color, LayerID, LayerOverride, refPoint1a[3], refPoint1b[3],
refPoint2a[3], refPoint2b[3], refPoint3[3],
textPoint[3], textDirection[3], dimNormal[3],
angularDimInfo[9], precision,
arrowLength, arrowHeadWidth, arrowHeadHeight, arrowHeadStyle, witnessGap,
witnessExt, dimValue, textHeight, arrowsOut, isDiameter, RadialDimensionflags]]

where:

dimensionCount= the number of dimensions found in the drawing view.

For each dimension, there exists a repeating
set of the following data:

dimensionType =will return 0 = Linear, 1 = Angular, 2 = Radial, 3 = Ordinate.

LineStyleIndex=
line style. Valid line styles as defined in swLineStyles_e.

LineWidth=
integer value defining the line width. Valid width values as defined in
swLineWeights_e.

Color=
COLORREF returned as an integer. Return value could be 0 or -1 for default
color.

LayerID=
integer value indicating which layer holds this entity. This integer value
is the array index value into the layerList array. The layerList array
can be obtained using LayerMgr::GetLayerList. A value of –1 indicates
that this item is not on a layer.

LayerOverride=
integer with bit flags set to determine which properties, if any, have
been overridden with respect to the Layer default properties. If the bit
value is set, then the specific property or properties have been overridden.
The bit indicators are: color = 0x1, style = 0x2, and width = 0x4. Therefore,
ifLayerOverridewas returned
as 3, you know the color and style have been specifically set for this
item and may not match the default values associated with this item's
layer.

refPoint1a[3]= array of three doubles.

refPoint1b[3]= array of three doubles.

refPoint2a[3]= array of three doubles.

refPoint2b[3]= array of three doubles.

refPoint3[3]= array of three doubles.

textPoint[3]= array of three doubles. This
is the upper-left corner of the dimension bounding box.

textDirection[3]= array of three doubles.

dimNormal[3]= array of three doubles.

angularDimInfo[9]=data is only returned for
angular dimensions. The array of 9 values is as follows:

quadrant= as defined in swQuadant_e.

directionLine1[3] =
array of three doubles

directionLine2[3] =
array of three doubles

isInteriorAngle=
BOOLEAN returned as a double. TRUE if it is an interior angle.

isFlipped= BOOLEAN returned as a double. TRUE if it is flipped.

precision=
number of decimal places.

arrowLength=
arrow length.

arrowHeadWidth=
arrowhead width.

arrowHeadHeight=
arrowhead height.

arrowHeadStyle=
arrowhead style as defined in swArrowStyle_e.

witnessGap=
extension gap.

witnessExt=
extension's extension.

dimValue=
dimension value.

textHeight=
dimension text height.

arrowsOut= BOOLEAN returned as a double and is TRUE if the arrows are outside.

isDiameter= BOOLEAN returned as a double and is used by radial dimensions.
If this value is TRUE, then thedimValuereturned will be the diameter value; if FALSE, then thedimValuereturned is the radial value.

RadialDimensionflags
=bit Code defining properties for radial dimensions or 0
if the dimension is not radial. See the RadialDimensionFlags enumeration.

This method is identical to View::GetDimensionInfo3 except when a fase
ordinate is not visible, the subordinates were not previously output,
regardless of whether they were visible or not. With this method, the
output of each subordinate, if it is visible, occurs regardless of whether
or not its base Ordinate is visible.
