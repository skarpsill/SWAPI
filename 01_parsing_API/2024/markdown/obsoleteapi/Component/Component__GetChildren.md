# Component::GetChildren

This method is obsolete and has been superseded by[Component2::GetChildren](sldworksAPI.chm::/Component2/Component2__GetChildren.htm).

Description

This method gets all the children components of this component object.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= Component.GetChildren ()

(Table)=========================================================

| Return: | (VARIANT)
retval | VARIANT
of type SafeArray of an array of pointers to Dispatch objects |
| --- | --- | --- |

Syntax (COM)

status
= Component->IGetChildren ( &retval )

(Table)=========================================================

| Output: | (LPCOMPONENT*)
retval | Pointer
to an array of Component objects |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S_OK
if successful |

Remarks

If this assembly component is a part document,
SolidWorks returns NULL. If this assembly component is the root component
or a subassembly, then this method returns the child components that belong
to the assembly document.

The typical order of calls needed in assembly
traversal is:

1. ModelDoc::GetActiveConfiguration
(called only once)

2. Configuration::GetRootComponent
(called only once)

3. Component::GetChildren
(called recursively)

Your assembly traversal routine must begin
from the root component and work its way down through the assembly structure.
This is done by recursively calling Component::GetChildren, as demonstrated
in the examples above. Call Component::GetActiveConfiguration and Component::GetRootComponent
once for the entire assembly. In addition, your assembly traversal must
begin with a ModelDoc object that is activated and visible, otherwise
the assembly structure might not be in tact.

COM applications should use to Component::IGetChildrenCount
to determine the number of component children, which is the size of the
array required to Component::IGetChildren.

You must call the GetChildren method recursively
because it returns only the immediate (one level) children. It does not
get child components of the sub-assemblies. For example, if one of the
child components of a component is a sub-assembly that has its own children,
those children are not returned by this method. You need to call this
method again from that sub-assembly component to get its children.

For a given component, this method returns
all of the immediate child components. This includes suppressed, hidden
and lightweight components. Use Component::Visible and Component::GetSuppression
to detect the component states.

Results of an assembly traversal vary based
on the configuration currently displayed in your main assembly and based
on the configuration referenced by the subassembly component. The list
of child components that this function returns can be different depending
on which configuration is referenced by the component (refer to ModelDoc::GetActiveConfiguration
and Component::ReferencedConfiguration).

For example, if one configuration of your
main assembly contains a suppressed subassembly, GetChildren returns an
empty array when you call it from that suppressed subassembly component.
As another example, a subassembly document (.sldasm file) can contain
several configurations, each of which has varying states of suppression
for its child components. When inserted into your main assembly, this
subassembly document can reference any of these configurations. As a result,
you might find that the child component suppression states vary based
on which configuration is referenced by the subassembly component (refer
to Component::ReferencedConfiguration).

Be aware that from call to call, this
method might not return components in the same order.
