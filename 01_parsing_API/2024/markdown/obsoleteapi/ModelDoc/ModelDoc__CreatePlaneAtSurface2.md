# ModelDoc::CreatePlaneAtSurface2

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by[ModelDoc2::CreatePlaneAtSurface2](../ModelDoc2/ModelDoc2__CreatePlaneAtSurface2.htm).

Description

This method creates a reference plane tangent
(or normal) to a surface.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.CreatePlaneAtSurface2 (interIndex, projOpt, reverseDir, normalPlane, angle)

(Table)=========================================================

| Input: | (int) interIndex | When there are multiple intersections, other
solutions may exist; for a surface, plane, and edge, the intersection
index is the intersection point to use when there are multiple intersections;
when the intersection index input is more than the number of intersection
points, the index of the last intersection point found will be used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BOOL) projOpt | For a sketch point and a surface, TRUE to project
the sketch plane point along the sketch plane normal, FALSE to project
the sketch plane point normal to the surface |
| Input: | (BOOL) reverseDir | Flag to create the plane on the opposite side
of the sketch plane |
| Input: | (BOOL) normalPlane | For a conical surface, TRUE to find the plane
normal to the surface, FALSE to find the plane tangent to the surface |
| Input: | (double) angle | Value of the angular offset of the normal plane,
relative to a chosen reference plane |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to a Dispatch object, the newly created
RefPlane object |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->ICreatePlaneAtSurface2 ( interIndex,
projOpt, reverseDir, normalPlane, angle, &retval )

| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT_BOOL) projOpt | For a sketch point and a surface, TRUE to project
the sketch plane point along the sketch plane normal, FALSE to project
the sketch plane point normal to the surface |
| Input: | (VARIANT_BOOL) reverseDir | Flag to create the plane on the opposite side
of the sketch plane |
| Input: | (VARIANT_BOOL)
normalPlane | For a conical surface, TRUE to find the plane
normal to the surface, FALSE
to find the plane tangent to the surface |
| Input: | (double) angle | Value of the angular offset of the normal plane,
relative to a chosen reference plane |
| Output: | (LPREFPLANE) retval | Pointer to the newly created RefPlane object |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method follows the current document setting
for displaying of the reference plane as it is created. If display of
reference planes is disabled, then you do not see the reference plane
on the screen as it is created. If display of reference planes is enabled,
then you do see it as it is created. ModelDoc2::GetUserPreferenceToggle
and ModelDoc2::SetUserPreferenceToggle with swDisplayPlanes enum value
get or set this display preference.

This method does not select the reference plane
after it is created. Objects that are selected before running this method
are still be selected when the method completeskadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}rather
than the newly created reference plane.

This method returns a RefPlane object. This object
can then be used for further operations on the reference plane feature.
Just having a RefPlane object may not be terribly useful, except that
it is a feature, which is an entity, so methods available on those objects
are available. For an OLE user, those functions are directly accessible;
for a COM user, those functions are available via use of a QueryInterface.
For example, if the reference plane must be selected, use Entity::Select.
