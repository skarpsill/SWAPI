# ModelDoc::InsertMfDraft

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by[ModelDoc::InsertMfDraft2](ModelDoc__InsertMfDraft2.htm).

Description

This method creates a multiface draft.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc.InsertMfDraft ( angle,
flipDir, isEdgeDraft, propType)

(Table)=========================================================

| Input: | (double) angle | Draft angle in radians |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BOOL) flipDir | Flip the direction of the draft; the draft direction is determined by
the selected direction which could be a planar face, a reference plane,
an edge, or two vertices; if you refer to the last argument in SelectByMark
and AndSelectByMark, these items would have a selection mark of 1; the
faces to be drafted have a selection mark of 2 and the draft edges have
a selection mark of 4 |
| Input: | (BOOL) isEdgeDraft | Determine if it is an edge or neutral plane draft; TRUE if this will
be an edge draft and the user will select edges to be drafted, FALSE if
this is to be a face draft and the user will select faces to be drafted
(the system will automatically select the faces next to the edge to be
drafted) |
| Input: | (long) propType | Propagation type |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->InsertMfDraft
( angle, flipDir, isEdgeDraft, propType )

(Table)=========================================================

| Input: | (double) angle | Draft angle in radians |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT_BOOL) flipDir | Flip the direction of the draft; the draft direction is determined by
the selected direction which could be a planar face, a reference plane,
an edge, or two vertices; if you refer to the last argument in SelectByMark
and AndSelectByMark, these items would have a selection mark of 1; the
faces to be drafted have a selection mark of 2 and the draft edges have
a selection mark of 4 |
| Input: | (VARIANT_BOOL) isEdgeDraft | Determine if it is an edge or neutral plane draft; TRUE if this will
be an edge draft and the user will select edges to be drafted, FALSE if
this is to be a face draft and the user will select faces to be drafted
(the system will automatically select the faces next to the edge to be
drafted) |
| Input: | (long) propType | Propagation type |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S_OK if successful |

Remarks

The propagation type argument propType can be:

- 0
  = no propagation
- 1
  = propagate to the next tangent faces that share the base neutral plane.
  This option can be specified for edge draft or neutral plane draft
- 2
  = propagate to all faces that are a neighbor of the neutral plane
- 3
  = propagate to all faces that are a neighbor of the neutral plane on all
  the inner_loops (e.g. all faces of a pocket or a boss)
- 4
  = propagate to all faces that are a neighbor of the neutral plane on the
  outer loop (e.g. the sides of a box with the bottom face as neutral plane)
