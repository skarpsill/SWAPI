## Remarks

This method returns all sub-features of the pattern feature. All of the sub-features returned by this method do not appear on the DimXpertManager tab of the Management Panel. Functional geometry sub-features such as planes and cylinders that represent each individual face of a part are for internal use only. These sub-features do not appear in the DimXpertManager tree. However, manufacturing sub-features that are significant for downstream machining and inspection of the pattern do appear in the DimXpertManager tree.

For example, the sub-features of a simple hole are related to functional geometry and are not listed in the DimXpertManager tree. However, the sub-features of a hole pattern are manufacturing features (e.g., simple holes) that are significant for downstream processes. These manufacturing features are listed in the DimXpertManager tree.
