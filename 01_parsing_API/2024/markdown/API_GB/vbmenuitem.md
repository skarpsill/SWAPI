# Creating Menu Commands (VB.NET)

This topic shows how to create a
VB.NET add-in in Microsoft Visual Studio that adds menu commands to
the context-sensitive and Tools menus of vaults in File
Explorer.

NOTE:Because SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional cannot force a reload of
add-ins if they are written in .NET, all client machines must be restarted to ensure that the latest version of the add-in is used.

1. StartMicrosoftVisual Studio.
2. Click File > New**>**Project .
3. Select Visual Basic in Installed and select Windows Desktop > Class Library**(.NET Framework)**as the template.
4. Type a name for the project in Name and
  click OK .
5. Click Project > Add Reference > Browse , click EPDM.Interop.epdm.dll , and click OK .
6. Right-click E**pdm.Interop.epdm**in the Solution Explorer,
  select Properties , and set Embed Interop Types to False to handle methods that pass arrays of structures.
7. Click Project > Add Reference >**Assembly > Framework**,
  clickSystem.Drawing, and
  click OK .
8. Click Close .
9. Right-click the name of the
  project in the Solution Explorer and select Properties .

  1. On the Application tab, clickAssembly Information.
  2. De-selectMake assembly COM-Visible .
  3. ##### On the Compile tab, select AnyCPU for the Target CPU, de-select Prefer
    32-bit , and select Register for COM interop .
10. Save the project.
11. Double-click Class1.vb in the Solution Explorer
  to open the code window.

  1. Before Public Class
    Class1 type:**Imports EPDM.Interop.epdm****Imports System.Runtime.InteropServices**< Guid ( "" )> _ < ComVisible ( True )> _
  2. To populate the GUID
    attribute above, click**Tools > Create GUID**in the IDE, select GUID
    Format
    6, click**Copy**, and click**Exit**. Replace< Guid ( "" )>with the copied string.
  3. Type Implements IEdmAddIn5 after Public Class
    Class1 and
    make sure that the GetAddInInfo and OnCmd methods are generated after
    you press Enter .
  4. Replace your add-in's
    implementation of the[IEdmAddIn5::GetAddInInfo](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmAddIn5~GetAddInInfo.html)method with the following code:

  Public
  Sub GetAddInInfo(ByRef poInfo As EdmAddInInfo, ByVal poVault As
  EIEdmVault5, ByVal poCmdMgr As IEdmCmdMgr5) Implements
  IEdmAddIn5.GetAddInInfo 'Specify the add-in information poInfo.mbsAddInName = "Menu command sample" poInfo.mbsCompany = "SOLIDWORKS Corporation" poInfo.mbsDescription = "Adds menu
  command items" poInfo.mlAddInVersion = 1 poInfo.mlRequiredVersionMajor = 5 poInfo.mlRequiredVersionMinor = 2 'Add
  menu command items (the command-ID numbers 1000 and 1001 are 'arbitrary; PDM does not use them;
  instead, PDM only passes them to the 'implementation of OnCmd
  to know which command was selected) poCmdMgr.AddCmd(1000, "First command",
  EdmMenuFlags.EdmMenu_Nothing, "This is the first command",
  "First command", 0, 99) poCmdMgr.AddCmd(1001, "Second command",
  EdmMenuFlags.EdmMenu_MustHaveSelection, "This is the second
  command", "Second command", 1, 99) End SubThe flagEdmMenuFlags.EdmMenu_MustHaveSelectionmeans that
  the second command is only available if the user has selected one or more
  files or folders.

  1. Replace your add-in's
    implementation of the IEdmAddIn5::OnCmd method with the
    following code (IEdmAddIn5::OnCmd is called when a menu command is selected by the
    user):

  Public Sub OnCmd(ByRef poCmd As EdmCmd,
  ByRef ppoData As System.Array) Implements IEdmAddIn5.OnCmd

  'Check the command ID to
  see which command was selected '(This only affects the
  caption of the message box below)Dim CommandName As String

  If poCmd.mlCmdID = 1000 Then CommandName = "The first command."

  Else CommandName = "The second command."

  End If

  'Retrieve the bounds of the
  array containing the selected files and foldersDim index As Long

  Dim last As Long

  index = LBound(ppoData)

  last = UBound(ppoData)

  Dim StrID As String

  'Create a message showing the
  names and IDs of all selected files and foldersDim message As String

  message = "You have selected the
  following files and folders: " + vbLf

  While index <= last If ppoData(index).mlObjectID1 = 0 Then message = message + "Folder: (ID="

  StrID
  = ppoData(index).mlObjectID2

  message
  = message + StrID + ") " Else message = message + "File: (ID="

  StrID
  = ppoData(index).mlObjectID1

  message
  = message + StrID + ") " End If message = message + ppoData(index).mbsStrData1 + vbLf index = index + 1 End While 'Display the message Dim v As EdmVault5 v = poCmd.mpoVault v.MsgBox(poCmd.mlParentWnd, message, EdmMBoxType.EdmMbt_OKOnly,
  CommandName) End Sub
12. Click Build > Build
  Solution to build the add-in.
13. I

  nstall
  the add-in through the SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional
  Administration tool:

  1. Open

    the SOLIDWORKS
    PDM Professional Administration tool.
  2. Expand the vault where
    you want to install this add-in and log in as Admin.
  3. Right-click

    Add-ins

    and click

    New
    Add-in

    .
  4. B

    rowse to

    project_path

    \

    project_name\project_name

    \bin\Debug

    ,
    click

    project_name

    .dll

    and

    EPDM.Interop.epdm.dll

    .
  5. Click

    Open

    .
  6. Click

    OK

    .
  7. Click

    OK

    .
14. The firstmenu command appears in the context-sensitive
  and Tools menus of vault files in File Explorer. The second menu command
  appears in the context-sensitive menus only when one or more files or folders are selected.Right-click a file in
  thevault and select Second
  command . A dialog similar to the following is displayed:
