## Remarks

If the file or its file data card contents have changed, this method creates a new version.

[IEdmBatchUnlock](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmBatchUnlock.html)is more efficient than this interface for checking in multiple files.

See[Return Codes](ReturnCodes.htm)for the complete list of potential success and error codes. The following are just a few examples:

- S_OK: The method successfully executed.
- S_FALSE: The method successfully executed, but as no file is modified, SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional did not create a new version.
- E_EDM_FILE_NOT_LOCKED_BY_YOU: The file is not checked out by the logged-in user.
- E_EDM_LOCKED_ON_OTHER_COMPUTER: The file is not checked out on the client machine where you tried to check it in.
- E_EDM_FILE_NOT_FOUND: The file is not part of the vault.
- E_EDM_LOCAL_FILE_NOT_FOUND: There is no copy of the file in the cache folder on the client machine.
- E_EDM_FILE_SHARE_ERROR: The file is open exclusively in another program.
- E_EDM_CANCELLED_BY_USER: Not implemented.
- E_EDM_INVALID_FILE: The file format is not recognized, and you have specified to not check in such files.
- E_EDM_MISSING_MANDATORY_VALUE: The file lacks a value for a required file data card variable.
- E_EDM_OPERATION_REFUSED_BY_PLUGIN: One of the loaded

  [EdmCmdType](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmdType.html)

  .EdmCmd_PreUndoLock hooks did not permit the operation.
- E_EDM_FILE_NOT_REGENERATED: The file needs to be rebuilt.
- E_EDM_NO_WORKFLOW: The document does not meet the conditions of any workflow.
- E_EDM_CIRCULAR_XREF: A cyclic file reference was detected.
- E_EDM_SWDRW_SETTO_USE_INDEPENDENT_REV_TABLE: An independent type revision setting is used in the drawing.
- E_EDM_NO_DOCTYPE: The document does not meet the conditions of any category.
- E_EDM_LOCKED_IN_OTHER_FOLDER: The file is checked out in another folder.
