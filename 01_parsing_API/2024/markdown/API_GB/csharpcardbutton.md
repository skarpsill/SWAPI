# Calling Add-ins (C#)

This
sample shows how to implement IEdmAddIn5::GetAddInInfo and IEdmAddIn5::OnCmd to create a Visual C# add-in
that is called when the user clicks a button in a file data card. The add-in
opens a dialog box in which the user browses for the file whose data card is
displayed. The add-in copies the path of the selected file to a text field in the
file's data card.NOTE:Because SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional cannot force a reload of
add-ins if they are written in .NET, all client machines must be restarted to ensure that the latest version of the add-in is used.

1. FollowCreating Menu Commands (C#) to
  create a basic add-in.
2. Register a hook
  to notify your add-in when a user clicks a button in a file data card.
  Implement IEdmAddIn5::GetAddInInfo as follows:
3. Implement IEdmAddIn5::OnCmd as follows:

  ```vb
        public void OnCmd(ref EdmCmd poCmd, ref Array ppoData)
        {
               //Respond only to a specific button command
               //The button command to respond to begins with "MyButton:" and ends with the name of the
               //variable to update in the card
               if (Strings.Left(poCmd.mbsComment, 9) == "MyButton:")
               {
                   //Get the name of the variable to update.
                   string VarName = null;
                   VarName = Strings.Right(poCmd.mbsComment, Strings.Len(poCmd.mbsComment) - 9);

                   //Let the user select the file whose path will be copied to the card variable
                   EdmVault5 vault = default(EdmVault5);
                   vault = (EdmVault5)poCmd.mpoVault;
                   IEdmStrLst5 PathList = default(IEdmStrLst5);
                   PathList = vault.BrowseForFile(poCmd.mlParentWnd, (int)EdmBrowseFlag.EdmBws_ForOpen + (int)EdmBrowseFlag.EdmBws_PermitVaultFiles, "", "", "", "", "Select File for " + VarName);

                   if ((PathList != null))
                   {
                       string path = null;
                       path = PathList.GetNext(PathList.GetHeadPosition());

                       //Store the path in the card variable
                       IEdmEnumeratorVariable5 vars = default(IEdmEnumeratorVariable5);
                       vars = (IEdmEnumeratorVariable5)poCmd.mpoExtra;
                       object VariantPath = null;
                       VariantPath = path;
                       vars.SetVar(VarName, "", VariantPath);
                   }
               }

               return;
        }
  ```
4. Click Build > Build
  Solution to build the add-in.
5. I

  nstall
  the add-in through the SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional
  Administration tool:
6. Click Cards > File Cards .
7. Double-click Text Card.
8. Add
  a button to the card.
9. Click the button.
10. In Caption , type Browse... .
11. InCommand
  type , select Run Add-in .
12. In Name of add-in, type MyButton:Title .
13. Save the card and exit the Card Editor.
14. Open
  File Explorer on the vault and select a checked-out text
  file.
15. Click Browse in the file's data card.
16. The
  Select File for Title dialog box pops up.
17. Browse to and select the
  checked-out text file.
18. Click Open to copy the path of the selected file to the Title field of the
  file's data card.

### Remarks

In this example, the value of a variable
is set using IEdmEnumeratorVariable5::SetVar . You
can also read values using IEdmEnumeratorVariable5::GetVar .

Usinga button handler like this
add-in, you can also:

- Retrieve
  the number of configurations, layouts, or both, in the file by inspecting the EdmCmdData::mpoExtra variable, which contains IEdmStrLst5 of file interfaces.
- Switch the active configuration.
- Set focus to a certain
  control using the members of EdmCmdData .
- Close the cardautomatically after
  the button handler
  returns by setting the EdmCmdData::mlLongData1 variable to one of the EdmCardFlag constants.
