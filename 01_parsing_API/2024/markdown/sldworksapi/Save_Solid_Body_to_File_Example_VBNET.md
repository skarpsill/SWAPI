# Save Solid Body to File Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to save a weldment member to another
part document.

```vb
'----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions: Open public_documents\samples\tutorial\api\weldment_box3.sldprt.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1. Updates the cut list in the weldment part.
 ' 2. Saves the first weldment member in the FeatureManager design tree to
 '    RefWeldment1.sldprt, and saves the cut list properties in the parent part
 '    to the cut list of the new part.
 ' 3. Opens RefWeldment1.sldprt and updates its cut list. (This step could
 '    take a few minutes to complete.)
 ' 4. At Stop, press F5.
 ' 5. Closes RefWeldment1.sldprt.
 ' 6. To verify steps 2 and 3, open and inspect RefWeldment1.sldprt, which resides
 '    in the same folder as this macro.
 '
 ' NOTE: Because weldment_box3.sldprt is used elsewhere, do not save changes.
