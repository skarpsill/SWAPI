.

### Property Value

True to automatically select all affected assembly components, false to manually select components (

see Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

See

[SweepFeatureData::AutoSelectComponents](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~SweepFeatureData~AutoSelectComponents.html)

.

## Examples

See the

[ISweepFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISweepFeatureData.html)

examples.

## Remarks

Use this property,[ISweepFeatureData::AssemblyFeatureScope](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISweepFeatureData~AssemblyFeatureScope.html), and[ISweepFeatureData::PropagateFeatureToParts](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISweepFeatureData~PropagateFeatureToParts.html)to insert sweep cuts into an assembly.

This API works with ISweepFeatureData::AssemblyFeatureScope to configure the scope of an assembly sweep feature. This API performs the same configuration that is done in the Feature Scope section of the PropertyManager page of the sweep feature:

| AssemblyFeatureScope setting | AutoSelectComponents setting | PropertyManager page Feature Scope setting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| False | Ignored | All components selected Auto-select not visible |
| True | If true, affected components are automatically selected If false, manually select the components before calling this API | Selected components selected If Auto-select is not checked, then manually select components |

See[Accessing Selections that Define Features](sldworksAPIProgGuide.chm::/Miscellaneous/Accessing_Selections_that_Define_Features.htm)for additional details.
