# Create Detail View Example (VBA)

This example shows how to create a detail view.

A named view is activated and a circle centered about the view's origin
is created. A detail view is then created at the origin of the sheet.
If you modify the macro to adjust the values to different locations, you
can see how the values affect the results.

The 1,1,0 represent 1m,1m,0m in sheet space. Most APIs expect units
of meters and radians for length and angle values, respectively.

NOTE:The call to IDrawingDoc::CreateDetailViewAt3
uses the x,y,z coordinates relative to the sheet's origin. The sheet's
origin is at the lower-left corner of the sheet. The x,y,z coordinates
represent the location on the sheet where to place the origin of the parent
view.

' Preconditions: Drawing document is open and contains
a Drawing View1.

' Postconditions: A circle is created about the activated
view's origin

'kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}and
a detail view is then created at the origin of the sheet.
