## Remarks

[ICurveDrivenPatternFeatureData::AccessSelections](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ICurveDrivenPatternFeatureData~AccessSelections.html)puts the model into a rollback state to allow access to the selections that define this feature.

Use this method to restore the rollback state if you did not modify the feature or use[IFeature::ModifyDefinition](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html)if you did.
