# Get Component Name From Selected Entity Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to get the name of a component to possibly use
with a future call to[IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~SelectByID2.html),
when selectively opening the assembly document and specific components
using[ISldWorks::OpenDoc7](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~OpenDoc7.html)and[IDocumentSpecification](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IDocumentSpecification.html),
etc. This example also shows how to get and set a component reference.

```
'--------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open an assembly document.
' 2. Select an entity (face, edge, vertex, or loop) on any
'    component in the graphics area.
' 3. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Adds a component reference to the component to which the
'    entity belongs.
' 2. Examine the Immediate window.
' 3. Locate the component to which the component reference was added
'    in the FeatureManager design tree. If necessary, use the scrollbar
'    at the bottom of the FeatureManager design tree to see the component
'    reference.
