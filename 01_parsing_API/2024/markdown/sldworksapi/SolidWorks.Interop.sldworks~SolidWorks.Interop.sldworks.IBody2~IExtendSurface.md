# IExtendSurface Method (IBody2)

Creates a new temporary body by extending the selected edges.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IExtendSurface( _
   ByVal EdgeCount As System.Integer, _
   ByRef EdgesToExtend As Edge, _
   ByVal ExtendLinear As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal EndCondition As System.Integer, _
   ByVal Dist As System.Double, _
   ByVal PUpToVtx As Vertex, _
   ByVal PUpToFace As Face _
) As Body2
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IBody2
Dim EdgeCount As System.Integer
Dim EdgesToExtend As Edge
Dim ExtendLinear As System.Boolean
Dim EndCondition As System.Integer
Dim Dist As System.Double
Dim PUpToVtx As Vertex
Dim PUpToFace As Face
Dim value As Body2

value = instance.IExtendSurface(EdgeCount, EdgesToExtend, ExtendLinear, EndCondition, Dist, PUpToVtx, PUpToFace)
```

### C#

```csharp
Body2 IExtendSurface(
   System.int EdgeCount,
   ref Edge EdgesToExtend,
   System.bool ExtendLinear,
   System.int EndCondition,
   System.double Dist,
   Vertex PUpToVtx,
   Face PUpToFace
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Body2^ IExtendSurface(
   System.int EdgeCount,
   Edge^% EdgesToExtend,
   System.bool ExtendLinear,
   System.int EndCondition,
   System.double Dist,
   Vertex^ PUpToVtx,
   Face^ PUpToFace
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `EdgeCount`: Number of edges to extend
- `EdgesToExtend`: Array of the selected

[edges](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IEdge.html)

to extend
- `ExtendLinear`: True to extend the selected edges linearly along the tangent of the face at the edges; false to extend the selected edges in the same direction as the face
- `EndCondition`: - 0 = Extend selected edges per value specified for Dist
- 1 = Extend selected edges to PUpToVtx
- 2 = Extend selected edges to PpUpToFace
- `Dist`: Distance by which to extend the selected edges (see**Remarks**)
- `PUpToVtx`: [Vertex](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IVertex.html)

up to which to extend the selected edges (see Remarks)
- `PUpToFace`: [Face](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFace2.html)

up to which to extend the selected edges (see Remarks)

### Return Value

Pointer to the newly created

[IBody2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IBody2.html)

object

## VBA Syntax

See

[Body2::IExtendSurface](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Body2~IExtendSurface.html)

.

## Remarks

This method supports surface bodies only.

You can extend the edges by a specified distance or up to a vertex or up to a face.
