# IGetPosition Method (IAnnotation)

Gets the position of this annotation.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetPosition() As System.Double
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IAnnotation
Dim value As System.Double

value = instance.IGetPosition()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.double IGetPosition()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.double IGetPosition();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

Pointer to an array of doubles (see

Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

See

[Annotation::IGetPosition](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Annotation~IGetPosition.html)

.

## Remarks

The retval is an array of 3 doubles, the x, y, z origin of the annotation.

If this method is not successful in retrieving the position of the annotation, the status value is S_false (COM only). Make sure that you check this value before using the returned position.

The following table lists the types of annotations that this method supports and the position of the x, y, z origin. In a drawing, the x, y, z origin is relative to the origin of the drawing sheet (the lower-left corner of the sheet).

| Type of Annotation | Position of XYZ Origin |
| --- | --- |
| Datum Feature Symbols | Point where leader hits symbol |
| Datum Target Symbols | Centerpoint of the circle that is attached to the leader |
| Dimensions | Upper-left corner of the text box of the dimension |
| Geometric Tolerances | Upper-left corner of the symbol |
| Notes | Upper-left corner of the text box |
| Surface Finish Symbols | Lower-left point of symbol |
| Table Annotations | Position of x,y,z determined by ITableAnnotation::AnchorType |
| Weld Symbols | Left endpoint of the main horizontal line in the symbol |

If you use this method on any other types of annotations, SOLIDWORKS takes no action
and returns false.
