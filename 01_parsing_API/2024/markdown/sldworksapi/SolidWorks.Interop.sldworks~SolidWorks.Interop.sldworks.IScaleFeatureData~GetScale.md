# GetScale Method (IScaleFeatureData)

Gets the scale factor for this scale feature in x, y,and z directions.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub GetScale( _
   ByRef X As System.Double, _
   ByRef Y As System.Double, _
   ByRef Z As System.Double, _
   ByRef Uniform As System.Boolean _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IScaleFeatureData
Dim X As System.Double
Dim Y As System.Double
Dim Z As System.Double
Dim Uniform As System.Boolean

instance.GetScale(X, Y, Z, Uniform)
```

### C#

```csharp
void GetScale(
   out System.double X,
   out System.double Y,
   out System.double Z,
   out System.bool Uniform
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void GetScale(
   [Out] System.double X,
   [Out] System.double Y,
   [Out] System.double Z,
   [Out] System.bool Uniform
)
```

### Parameters

- `X`: X-direction scale factor
- `Y`: Y-direction scale factor
- `Z`: Z-direction scale factor
- `Uniform`: True for uniform scaling, false for non-uniform scaling
