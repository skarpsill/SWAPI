# IAccessSelections2 Method (IProjectionCurveFeatureData)

Gains access to the selections used to define the projected curve.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IAccessSelections2( _
   ByVal TopDoc As ModelDoc2, _
   ByVal Component As Component2 _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IProjectionCurveFeatureData
Dim TopDoc As ModelDoc2
Dim Component As Component2
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.IAccessSelections2(TopDoc, Component)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool IAccessSelections2(
   ModelDoc2 TopDoc,
   Component2 Component
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool IAccessSelections2(
   ModelDoc2^ TopDoc,
   Component2^ Component
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `TopDoc`: Top-level document (see**Remarks**)
- `Component`: Component in which the feature is to be modified (see

Remarks

)

### Return Value

True if the selections were successfully accessed, false if not
