# GetID Method (ISketchHatch)

Gets the ID for this sketch hatch.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetID() As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISketchHatch
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.GetID()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object GetID()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ GetID();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

Array with two longs or two integers (see[Long vs. Integer](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/overview/Long_vs_Integer.htm)) identifying this sketch hatch ID (see**Remarks**)

## VBA Syntax

See

[SketchHatch::GetID](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~SketchHatch~GetID.html)

.

## Examples

See the

[ISketchHatch](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISketchHatch.html)

examples.

## Remarks

The ID of the sketch hatch:

- is an ordered pair (i1, i2). The combination of these two numbers is always unique within a specific sketch.
- cannot be assigned by applications or users.
- is not the same as a

  [persistent reference ID](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/overview/Persistent_Reference_IDs.htm)

  .

Each entity within a specific sketch has a unique ID. However, a sketch line can have the same ID values as a sketch arc within the same sketch. Likewise, in a second sketch, you may find a different sketch element with the same ID. Therefore, your application must keep track of:

- sketch element type (that is, point, line, arc, spline, and so on)
- owning sketch name
- sketch element ID to uniquely identify a sketched item

You can determine the sketch element type by using[ISketchSegment::GetType](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchSegment~GetType.html).
