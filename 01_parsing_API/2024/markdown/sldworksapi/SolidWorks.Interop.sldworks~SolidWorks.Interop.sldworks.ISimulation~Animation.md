.

### Property Value

[Animation](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IAnimation.html)

## VBA Syntax

See

[Simulation::Animation](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Simulation~Animation.html)

.

## Remarks

| To... | Then.. . |
| --- | --- |
| Get the duration of an animation | Use IAnimation::Duration after using this property |
| Play the animation | Use IAnimation::Play after using this property |
| Display the Animation Controller pop-up toolbar | Use ISimulation::PlayAnimation instead of using this property |

NOTE:Use only the following IAnimation property and method with ISimulation::Animation: IAnimation::Duration and IAnimation::PlayAnimation. The other IAnimation properties and methods do nothing with an IAnimation object returned by ISimlulation::Animation because they expect an animation to be playing. Use[ISimluation::IsAnimationPlaying](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISimulation~IsAnimationPlaying.html)to determine whether an animation is playing.
