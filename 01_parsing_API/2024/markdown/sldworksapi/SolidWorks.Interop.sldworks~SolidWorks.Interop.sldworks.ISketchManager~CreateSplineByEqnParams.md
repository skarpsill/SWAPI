# CreateSplineByEqnParams Method (ISketchManager)

Creates a B-curve from B-spline data; that is, a set of B-spline vertices (control points) and a knot vector.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function CreateSplineByEqnParams( _
   ByVal Parameters As System.Object _
) As SketchSegment
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISketchManager
Dim Parameters As System.Object
Dim value As SketchSegment

value = instance.CreateSplineByEqnParams(Parameters)
```

### C#

```csharp
SketchSegment CreateSplineByEqnParams(
   System.object Parameters
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
SketchSegment^ CreateSplineByEqnParams(
   System.Object^ Parameters
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Parameters`: Array containing an array of doubles to use in creating the spline (see

Remarks

)

### Return Value

[Sketch segment](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchSegment.html)

for the spline

## VBA Syntax

See

[SketchManager::CreateSplineByEqnParams](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/Sldworks~SketchManager~CreateSplineByEqnParams.html)

.

## Remarks

The Properties array contains four longs (placed in the first four doubles in the array):

- Dimension
- Order
- Number of Control Points
- Periodicity ( true or false)

The Knots array contains doubles with (Number of Control Points + Order) elements.

The size of the ControlPoints array is based upon the curve dimension.

- Dimension = 2 then each Control Point is an array of 2 doubles ( x, y )
- Dimension = 3 then each Control Point is an array of 3 doubles ( x, y, z)
- Dimension = 4 then each Control Point is an array of 4 doubles ( x, y, z, w ) where w = weight

The parameters are provided as three arrays.

Pass the control point coordinates to this routine in sketch space. The Z value iskadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}interpreted as 0. In certain situations, you must transform your B-curve parameters to sketch space using[ISketch::ModelToSketchTransform](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketch~ModelToSketchTransform.html).

NOTE:The curve can be either periodic or non-periodic. If the generated spline is a closed spline, then it must be flagged as periodic. Additionally, splines generated in sketches must be G1 continuous. If the data passed to this method does not generate a G1 continuous spline, then it is rejected and a spline is not created. If your data is not G1 continuous, then you must split the spline into multiple G1 segments and call this method for each segment.

This method does not work with[ISketchManager::AddToDB](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchManager~AddToDB.html)or[ISketchManager::DisplayWhenAdded](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchManager~DisplayWhenAdded.html). It always adds the spline directly to the database (as if ISketchManager::AddToDB(True) is in effect), and you must redraw your document window to see the entities that you added (as if ISketchManager::DisplayWhenAdded(False) is in effect).

To create 3D splines, see[IModelDoc2::InsertCurveFilePoint](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~InsertCurveFilePoint.html)and related functions.
