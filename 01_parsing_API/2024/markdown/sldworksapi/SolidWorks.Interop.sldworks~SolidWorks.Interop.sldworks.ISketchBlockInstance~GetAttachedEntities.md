(Table)=========================================================

| Possible returned Entities | Possible returned EntityTypes |
| --- | --- |
| IFace2 | swSelFACES |
| IEdge | swSelEDGES |
| IVertex | swSelVERTICES |
| ISketchSegment | swSelSKETCHSEGS |
| ISketchPoint | swSelSKETCHPOINTS |

A block instance that was inserted with a leader attached to an entity remains attached to that entity even if the leader is hidden. If the leader is shown again later on, the leader still points to the entity and the block instance is still properly associated with the entity.
