.

## VBA Syntax

See

[ActiveDocChangeNotify Event (SldWorks)](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/SldWorks~SldWorks~ActiveDocChangeNotify_EV.html)

.

## Remarks

For example, if you open two documents and then selectWindow, New Windowfor one of the documents, you will have three windows visible in your SOLIDWORKS session. This event is sent when you switch between any combination of those windows.

This event is only sent when the active window in the SOLIDWORKS session actually changes to a new active window. Window activations are not guaranteed during, for example, the shutdown of the SOLIDWORKS application. For example, if the SOLIDWORKS application closes a non-active document, then there re is no need to activate a new window.

If developing a C++ application, use

[swAppDocChangeNotify](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swAppNotify_e.html)

to register for this notification.
