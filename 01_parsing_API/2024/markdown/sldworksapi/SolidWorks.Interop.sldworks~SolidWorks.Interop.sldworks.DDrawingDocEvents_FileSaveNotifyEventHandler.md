# DDrawingDocEvents_FileSaveNotifyEventHandler Delegate (SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks)

Pre-notifies the user program when a file is about to be saved and passes the current document name.

## Syntax

Public Delegate Function DDrawingDocEvents_FileSaveNotifyEventHandler( _
   ByVal FileName As System.String _
) As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As New DDrawingDocEvents_FileSaveNotifyEventHandler(AddressOf HandlerMethod)
```

### C#

```csharp

   System.string FileName
)

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `FileName`: Name of the file to save

## VBA Syntax

See

[FileSaveNotify Event (DrawingDoc)](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/SldWorks~DrawingDoc~FileSaveNotify_EV.html)

.

## Remarks

When a user selectsFile,Savefor a document that has never been saved, SOLIDWORKS generates[FileSaveAsNotify2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.DDrawingDocEvents_FileSaveAsNotify2EventHandler.html)instead of FileSaveNotify. You can return S_false to stop SOLIDWORKS from proceeding with the action that generated the notification.

If the user attempts to close the document and S_false is returned, then the document does not close; it remains open and is not saved.

If developing a C++ application, use

[swDrawingFileSaveAsNotify2](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swDrawingNotify_e.html)

to register for this notification.
