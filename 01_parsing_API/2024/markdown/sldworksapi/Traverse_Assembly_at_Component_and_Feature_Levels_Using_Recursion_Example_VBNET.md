# Traverse Assembly at Component and Feature Levels Using Recursion Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to traverse an assembly at the component and
feature levels using recursion.

```
'-------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open an assembly document containing nested subassemblies.
' 2. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Traverses the assembly.
' 2. Examine the Immediate window.
