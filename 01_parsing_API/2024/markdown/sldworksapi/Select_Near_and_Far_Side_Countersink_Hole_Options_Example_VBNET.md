# Select Near and Far Side Hole Wizard Countersink Features Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to select near and far side Hole Wizard countersink
features.

```vb
 '----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
 ' 1. Open a part that contains a Hole Wizard hole named, Hole1.
 ' 2. Modify the countersink diameter and angle values as required by Hole1.
 ' 3. Open an Immediate window.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1. Inspect the Immediate window.
 ' 2. The current near side countersink option is displayed.
 ' 3. The current far side countersink option is displayed.
 ' 4. The near side countersink option is toggled.
 '    If the near side countersink option is selected,
 '    the proper angle and diameter are set.
 ' 5. The far side countersink option is toggled.
 '    If the far side countersink option is selected,
 '    the proper angle and diameter are set.
 ' 6. The new near side countersink option is displayed.
 ' 7. The new far side countersink option is displayed.
