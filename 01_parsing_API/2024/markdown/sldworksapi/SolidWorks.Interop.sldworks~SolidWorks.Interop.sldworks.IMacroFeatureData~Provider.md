# Provider Property (IMacroFeatureData)

Gets or sets the error message to display in the What's Wrong dialog when a non-embedded macro feature fails to rebuild due to missing files.

## Syntax

Property Provider As System.String
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IMacroFeatureData
Dim value As System.String

instance.Provider = value

value = instance.Provider
```

### C#

```csharp
System.string Provider {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp

See

.

### Property Value

Error message

## VBA Syntax

See

[MacroFeatureData::Provider](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~MacroFeatureData~Provider.html)

.

## Remarks

This property allows you to replace the generic error message that appears in the What's Wrong dialog with a more detailed error message when this non-embedded macro feature fails to load or rebuild due to missing files.

Possible causes of macro feature rebuild failure:

- The model contains this COM-based macro feature, but the rebuild, edit, and security callbacks exist in an add-in that SOLIDWORKS cannot locate.
- The model references this non-embedded macro feature which exists in a VBA macro that SOLIDWORKS cannot locate.
- Third-party DLLs, add-in files, or other files associated with this non-embedded macro feature are missing.

**NOTE:**All files required by embedded macro features are serialized with the model, so**File not found**errors do not occur for embedded macros, and this property need not be set for them.
