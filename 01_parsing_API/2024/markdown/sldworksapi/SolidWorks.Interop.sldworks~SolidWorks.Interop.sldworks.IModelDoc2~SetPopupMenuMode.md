Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

See

[ModelDoc2::SetPopupMenuMode](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~ModelDoc2~SetPopupMenuMode.html)

.

## Remarks

When end users press the right-mouse button on an entity in the graphics window, they are be presented with one of two menu sets. These menu sets are defined as mode 0 and mode 1.

**Mode**

- 0 - Default shortcut mode. This mode presents the end user with options toSelect Other, manipulate the view, access the properties dialog of the selected item, and so on.
- 1 - The end-user is presented with a limited set of choices includingSelect OtherandClear Selection. This mode is typically seen when a SOLIDWORKS dialog is active and the user is restricted to entity selection.

Using this method, you can simulate the same shortcut menu behavior as in the SOLIDWORKS user interface. If you have a dialog that requires user selection of entities, you can set the pop-up menu mode to 1 to simulate SOLIDWORKS behavior. Your application should always set the menu mode back to its previous value. To determine the previous behavior, call[IModelDoc2::GetPopupMenuMode](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~GetPopupMenuMode.html)prior to calling to this method.
