# IAdd3 Method (IEquationMgr)

Adds an equation at the specified index for the specified configurations.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IAdd3( _
   ByVal Index As System.Integer, _
   ByVal Equation As System.String, _
   ByVal Solve As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal WhichConfigurations As System.Integer, _
   ByVal ConfigCount As System.Integer, _
   ByRef ConfigNames As System.String _
) As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IEquationMgr
Dim Index As System.Integer
Dim Equation As System.String
Dim Solve As System.Boolean
Dim WhichConfigurations As System.Integer
Dim ConfigCount As System.Integer
Dim ConfigNames As System.String
Dim value As System.Integer

value = instance.IAdd3(Index, Equation, Solve, WhichConfigurations, ConfigCount, ConfigNames)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int IAdd3(
   System.int Index,
   System.string Equation,
   System.bool Solve,
   System.int WhichConfigurations,
   System.int ConfigCount,
   ref System.string ConfigNames
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.int IAdd3(
   System.int Index,
   System.String^ Equation,
   System.bool Solve,
   System.int WhichConfigurations,
   System.int ConfigCount,
   System.String^% ConfigNames
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Index`: 0-based index of the new equation (-1 places it at the end of the list)
- `Equation`: String containing the equation (see

Remarks

)
- `Solve`: True to solve the equation immediately; false to solve it later (see

Remarks

)
- `WhichConfigurations`: Configuration option as defined in

[swInConfigurationOpts_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swInConfigurationOpts_e.html)

(see

Remarks

)
- `ConfigCount`: Number of names in the ConfigNames array
- `ConfigNames`: - in-process, in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of strings containing configuration names

- VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

### Return Value

Index of the new equation, -1 if error

## Remarks

This method only works for parts having multple configurations created in SOLIDWORKS 2014 or later. Use this method to add dimension equations, component equations, or global variable assignments to various configurations of models. If you don't have multiple configurations, then call[IEquationMgr::Add2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IEquationMgr~Add2.html), which does not support configurations and is slightly faster.

To add an equation using the SOLIDWORKS user interface, you must embed the names of dimensions and global variables in double quotes:

- Global variable assignment:

  "B" = 2
- Component equation:

  "N_SPOKES@CirPattern" = "BARLENGTH@Sketch2" /10
- Dimension equation that uses the Visual Basic IIf function:

  "D1@Extrude2" = (IIf("D1@Extrude3">20, 15, 6))+5
- Dimension equation that sets a dimension to the current value:

  "D1@Extrude2" =

**NOTE:**To add an equation:

- you must specify Equation with the names of dimensions and global variables in double double quotes and the entire equation in double quotes. See the Examples.
- directly to an assembly component's model, you must call

  [IAssemblyDoc::EditPart2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IAssemblyDoc~EditPart2.html)

  before calling this method.

You can add a dimension equation whose left-hand side already exists, but only if the existing equation is suppressed. Adding the equation again unsuppresses it. See[IEquationMgr::ChangeSuppressionForAllConfigurations](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IEquationMgr~ChangeSuppressionForAllConfigurations.html)and[IEquationMgr::ChangeSuppressionForConfiguration](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IEquationMgr~ChangeSuppressionForConfiguration.html).

Setting Solve to false delays evaluation of this equation, which enhances performance when there are many equations to solve. When Solve is set to false, the equation appears in the FeatureManager design tree only after calling[IEquationMgr::EvaluateAll](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IEquationMgr~EvaluateAll.html)or[IModelDoc2::EditRebuild3](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~EditRebuild3.html).

When adding global variable assignments and component equations, WhichConfigurations must be set to[swInConfigurationOpts_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swInConfigurationOpts_e.html).swAllConfiguration.

If you add a global variable assignment that already exists, this method returns an error.

To modify an equation added by this method, call[IEquationMgr::ISetEquationAndConfigurationOption](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IEquationMgr~ISetEquationAndConfigurationOption.html).

When you add an equation, you are adding it to the list of relations. Thus, do not add an equation while traversing the equations in a model, because SOLIDWORKS could crash.
