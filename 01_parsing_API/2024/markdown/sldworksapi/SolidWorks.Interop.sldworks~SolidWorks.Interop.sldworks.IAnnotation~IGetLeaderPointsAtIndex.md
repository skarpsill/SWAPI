# IGetLeaderPointsAtIndex Method (IAnnotation)

Gets coordinate information about a specified leader on this annotation.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetLeaderPointsAtIndex( _
   ByVal Index As System.Integer, _
   ByVal PointCount As System.Integer _
) As System.Double
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IAnnotation
Dim Index As System.Integer
Dim PointCount As System.Integer
Dim value As System.Double

value = instance.IGetLeaderPointsAtIndex(Index, PointCount)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.double IGetLeaderPointsAtIndex(
   System.int Index,
   System.int PointCount
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.double IGetLeaderPointsAtIndex(
   System.int Index,
   System.int PointCount
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Index`: Index of leader within this annotation (see

Remarks

)
- `PointCount`: Number of (x,y,z) points to return in the array

### Return Value

- in-process, in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of doubles (see

  Remarks

  )

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

## Remarks

The index value is 0-based. Therefore, a valid index value is greater than or equal to 0, but less than the number of leaders on this annotation.

Use[IAnnotation::GetLeaderCount](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IAnnotation~GetLeaderCount.html)to find out how many leaders are on this annotation. If the index value is invalid in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), then SOLIDWORKS returns an empty SafeArray or S_false.

You must determine the number of points in the leader to use the data returned by this method. The number of points is a function of the number of segments in the leader. There can be one or two segments in a leader line, depending on whether or not it is a straight, bent, or underlined leader. Use[IAnnotation::GetLeaderStyle](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IAnnotation~GetLeaderStyle.html)
to determine the number of points in the leader.

- If IAnnotation::GetLeaderStyle returns swNO_LEADER, then the number of points = 0.
- If IAnnotation::GetLeaderStyle returns swSTRAIGHT and swUNDERLINED then the number

  of points = 2.
- If IAnnotation::GetLeaderStyle returns swBENT, then the number of points = 3.

Additionally, for the COM interface, you must determine the number of points to allocate the appropriate size array for the return value. The number of points must also be passed to the method to help prevent overwrite problems if you have not allocated an array that is the correct size. If the number of points passed does not match what is found, SOLIDWORKS does not return any point information and returns S_false.

The format of the return array is:

retval[0] = X-coordinate of first leader point

retval[1] = Y-coordinate of first leader point

retval[2] = Z-coordinate of first leader point

retval[3] = X-coordinate of second leader point

retval[4] = Y-coordinate of second leader point

retval[5] = Z-coordinate of second leader point

retval[6] = X-coordinate of third leader point

retval[7] = Y-coordinate of third leader point

retval[8] = Z-coordinate of third leader point

You cannot directly set the leader coordinate information. The leader coordinates are computed based on the annotations text and attachment points. Use[IAnnotation::GetPosition](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IAnnotation~GetPosition.html)and[IAnnotation::SetPosition](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IAnnotation~SetPosition.html)to get and set the text point.
