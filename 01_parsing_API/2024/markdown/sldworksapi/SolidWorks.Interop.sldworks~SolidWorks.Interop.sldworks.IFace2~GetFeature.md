## Remarks

In SOLIDWORKS, a face:

- is the result of evaluating a feature.
- can be owned by several features.

[IFeature::GetFaces](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetFaces.html)or[IFeature::IGetFaces2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~IGetFaces2.html)returns all of the faces owned by a feature. This is different from the faces highlighted in the user interface when the feature is selected. The user interface filters out multiple feature faces. This filter is only for display purposes.

To filter out multiple feature faces using the SOLIDWORKS API, you must call IFace2::GetFeature or[IFace2::IGetFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFace2~IGetFeature.html). Only the oldest feature from the face is returned, that is, the first owning feature in the FeatureManager design tree.
