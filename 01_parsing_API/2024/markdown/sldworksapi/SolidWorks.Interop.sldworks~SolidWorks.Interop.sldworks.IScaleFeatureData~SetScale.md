# SetScale Method (IScaleFeatureData)

Sets the scale factor for this scale feature in the x, y,and z directions.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub SetScale( _
   ByVal X As System.Double, _
   ByVal Y As System.Double, _
   ByVal Z As System.Double, _
   ByVal Uniform As System.Boolean _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IScaleFeatureData
Dim X As System.Double
Dim Y As System.Double
Dim Z As System.Double
Dim Uniform As System.Boolean

instance.SetScale(X, Y, Z, Uniform)
```

### C#

```csharp
void SetScale(
   System.double X,
   System.double Y,
   System.double Z,
   System.bool Uniform
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void SetScale(
   System.double X,
   System.double Y,
   System.double Z,
   System.bool Uniform
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `X`: X-direction scale factor
- `Y`: Y-direction scale factor
- `Z`: Z-direction scale factor
- `Uniform`: True for uniform scaling, false for non-uniform scaling
