# FeatureCircularPattern2 Method (IFeatureManager)

Obsolete. Superseded by

[IFeatureManager::FeatureCircularPattern3](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~FeatureCircularPattern3.html)

.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function FeatureCircularPattern2( _
   ByVal Num As System.Integer, _
   ByVal Spacing As System.Double, _
   ByVal FlipDir As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal DName As System.String, _
   ByVal GeometryPattern As System.Boolean _
) As Feature
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeatureManager
Dim Num As System.Integer
Dim Spacing As System.Double
Dim FlipDir As System.Boolean
Dim DName As System.String
Dim GeometryPattern As System.Boolean
Dim value As Feature

value = instance.FeatureCircularPattern2(Num, Spacing, FlipDir, DName, GeometryPattern)
```

### C#

```csharp
Feature FeatureCircularPattern2(
   System.int Num,
   System.double Spacing,
   System.bool FlipDir,
   System.string DName,
   System.bool GeometryPattern
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Feature^ FeatureCircularPattern2(
   System.int Num,
   System.double Spacing,
   System.bool FlipDir,
   System.String^ DName,
   System.bool GeometryPattern
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Num`: Number of instances of the circular pattern to insert, including the original
- `Spacing`: Spacing between each instance of the circular pattern in radians
- `FlipDir`: True to flip the direction of the circular pattern, false to not
- `DName`: Name of the angular dimension defining the direction of the pattern
- `GeometryPattern`: True to use geometry pattern, false to not

### Return Value

Pointer to the

[IFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature.html)

object

## VBA Syntax

See

[FeatureManager::FeatureCircularPattern2](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~FeatureManager~FeatureCircularPattern2.html)

.

## Remarks

This method requires ordered selection of the features and components.

- Features and axis: Use[IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~SelectByID2.html)with a Mark of 4 for the features to pattern and a Mark of 1 for the axis. You can also use[IFeature::Select2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~Select2.html)to select the features and the axis.
- Components and axis: Use IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2 with a Mark of 1 for the components to pattern and a Mark of 2 for the axis.

You must select the features or components before selecting the axis.
