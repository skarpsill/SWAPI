# Add ActiveX Tabs to FeatureManager Design Tree Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to add tabs to a split FeatureManager design tree using
an on-disk bitmap file for the tabs' icons.

```vb
 '----------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
 ' 1. In the IDE, reference your ActiveX control file
 '    (click Project > Add Reference > Browse and browse
 '    to the folder where the ActiveX control resides and click
 '    the ActiveX control file > OK).
 ' 2. Verify that the specified part document and bitmap exist.
 ' 3. Replace activex_control_component_declaration and
 '    activex_control_CLSID_or_ProgID with your ActiveX control's
 '    information.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1. Opens the part document and splits the FeatureManager
 '    design tree.
 ' 2. Adds a new tab to each FeatureManager design tree.
 ' 3. Activates the new tab on the top of the FeatureManager
 '    design tree.

 ' NOTE: Because the part document is used elsewhere,
 ' do not save changes.
