# CreateLine Method (ISketchManager)

Creates a sketch line in the currently active 2D or 3D sketch.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function CreateLine( _
   ByVal X1 As System.Double, _
   ByVal Y1 As System.Double, _
   ByVal Z1 As System.Double, _
   ByVal X2 As System.Double, _
   ByVal Y2 As System.Double, _
   ByVal Z2 As System.Double _
) As SketchSegment
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISketchManager
Dim X1 As System.Double
Dim Y1 As System.Double
Dim Z1 As System.Double
Dim X2 As System.Double
Dim Y2 As System.Double
Dim Z2 As System.Double
Dim value As SketchSegment

value = instance.CreateLine(X1, Y1, Z1, X2, Y2, Z2)
```

### C#

```csharp
SketchSegment CreateLine(
   System.double X1,
   System.double Y1,
   System.double Z1,
   System.double X2,
   System.double Y2,
   System.double Z2
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
SketchSegment^ CreateLine(
   System.double X1,
   System.double Y1,
   System.double Z1,
   System.double X2,
   System.double Y2,
   System.double Z2
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `X1`: X coordinate of the line start point
- `Y1`: Y coordinate of the line start point
- `Z1`: Z coordinate of the line start point
- `X2`: X coordinate of the line end point
- `Y2`: Y coordinate of the line end point
- `Z2`: Z coordinate of the line end point

### Return Value

[Sketch segment](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchSegment.html)

for the line

## VBA Syntax

[Create Section View and Get Some Data (C#)](Create_Section_View_and_Get_Some_Data_Example_CSharp.htm)

## Remarks

If a sketch is not active, then the line is not created and NULL is returned. You can check for an active sketch using the[ISketchManager::ActiveSketch](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchManager~ActiveSketch.html)function.

[ISketchManager::AddToDB](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchManager~AddToDB.html)and[ISketchManager::DisplayWhenAdded](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchManager~DisplayWhenAdded.html)increase performance during entity creation by adding entities directly to the SOLIDWORKS database. ISketchManager::AddToDB also avoids inferencing.

When this method is used with a drawing document, this method creates the line relative to the active drawing view,[IDrawingDoc::ActiveDrawingView](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IDrawingDoc~ActiveDrawingView.html)or[IDrawingDoc::IActiveDrawingView](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IDrawingDoc~IActiveDrawingView.html).
