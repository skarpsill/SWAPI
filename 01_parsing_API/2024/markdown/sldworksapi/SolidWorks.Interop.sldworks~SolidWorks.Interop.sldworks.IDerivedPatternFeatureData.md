## Remarks

Read[Pattern Features and their Feature Data Objects](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/Pattern_Features_and_their_Feature_Data_Objects.htm).

Before calling IFeatureManager::CreateDefinition, you can pre-select the entities needed to create the derived pattern feature. Use[IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~SelectByID2.html)to select the seed components and pattern feature in any order using Marks:

- seed componentkadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}= 1
- pattern feature = 2

Or, after calling IFeatureManager::CreateDefinition, you can explicitly set the corresponding properties on this feature data object.

Either way, you must call[IFeatureManager::CreateFeature](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~CreateFeature.html)after initializing this feature data object in order to successfully create the derived pattern feature.

**N OTE**: A derived pattern feature is also called a pattern driven pattern feature.

For more information, see the**SOLIDWORKS user-interface help > Assemblies > Basic Component Operations > Component Patterns > Pattern Driven Component Pattern PropertyManager**topic.
