# SetDraftAngle Method (IExtrudeFeatureData2)

Sets the draft angle of the extrusion in the forward or reverse direction.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub SetDraftAngle( _
   ByVal Forward As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal DraftAngle As System.Double _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IExtrudeFeatureData2
Dim Forward As System.Boolean
Dim DraftAngle As System.Double

instance.SetDraftAngle(Forward, DraftAngle)
```

### C#

```csharp
void SetDraftAngle(
   System.bool Forward,
   System.double DraftAngle
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void SetDraftAngle(
   System.bool Forward,
   System.double DraftAngle
)
```
