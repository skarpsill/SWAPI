# IGetMiddleSurface Method (IBody2)

Inserts a midsurface in a body.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetMiddleSurface( _
   ByVal PlacementPercentage As System.Double, _
   ByRef Face1List As System.Object, _
   ByRef Face2List As System.Object, _
   ByRef Thickness As System.Object, _
   ByRef MiddleSurfaceBody As Body2 _
) As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IBody2
Dim PlacementPercentage As System.Double
Dim Face1List As System.Object
Dim Face2List As System.Object
Dim Thickness As System.Object
Dim MiddleSurfaceBody As Body2
Dim value As System.Integer

value = instance.IGetMiddleSurface(PlacementPercentage, Face1List, Face2List, Thickness, MiddleSurfaceBody)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int IGetMiddleSurface(
   System.double PlacementPercentage,
   out System.object Face1List,
   out System.object Face2List,
   out System.object Thickness,
   out Body2 MiddleSurfaceBody
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.int IGetMiddleSurface(
   System.double PlacementPercentage,
   [Out] System.Object^ Face1List,
   [Out] System.Object^ Face2List,
   [Out] System.Object^ Thickness,
   [Out] Body2^ MiddleSurfaceBody
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `PlacementPercentage`: Position where to insert the midsurface in the body; value of 50 indicates to insert the surface in the middle
- `Face1List`: Array of faces into which the midsurface will be or was inserted; you can provide an array of faces for this parameter and Face2List; if you do not, then the faces are determined internally
- `Face2List`: Array of faces into which the midsurface will be or was inserted; you can provide an array of faces for this parameter and Face1List; if you do not, then the faces are determined internally
- `Thickness`: Array containing minimum and maximum thickness of sheet metal for pairs of faces
- `MiddleSurfaceBody`: [Middle surface body](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IBody2.html)
