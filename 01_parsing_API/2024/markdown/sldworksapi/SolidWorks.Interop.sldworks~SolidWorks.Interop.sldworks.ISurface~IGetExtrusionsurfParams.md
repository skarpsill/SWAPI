# IGetExtrusionsurfParams Method (ISurface)

Gets the parameters for the extrusion surface.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetExtrusionsurfParams() As System.Double
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISurface
Dim value As System.Double

value = instance.IGetExtrusionsurfParams()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.double IGetExtrusionsurfParams()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.double IGetExtrusionsurfParams();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of doubles giving extrusion surface parameters

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

## VBA Syntax

See

[Surface::IGetExtrusionsurfParams](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Surface~IGetExtrusionsurfParams.html)

.

## Remarks

An extrusion surface is constructed by extruding a profile curve (line or arc or b-spline) along a direction vector. You can retrieve the profile curve for the extrusion using[ISurface::GetProfileCurve](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISurface~GetProfileCurve.html)or[ISurface::IGetProfileCurve](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISurface~IGetProfileCurve.html).

Three doubles of parameters returned,`DirectionVector[3]`, which is the direction vector along which the profile curve is extruded.
