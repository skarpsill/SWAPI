# IGetNextFace Method (IMidSurface2)

Obsolete. Superseded by

[IMidSurface3::IGetNextFace](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IMidSurface3~IGetNextFace.html)

.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetNextFace( _
   ByRef FromFace1Disp As Face2, _
   ByRef FromFace2Disp As Face2, _
   ByRef Thickness As System.Double _
) As Face2
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IMidSurface2
Dim FromFace1Disp As Face2
Dim FromFace2Disp As Face2
Dim Thickness As System.Double
Dim value As Face2

value = instance.IGetNextFace(FromFace1Disp, FromFace2Disp, Thickness)
```

### C#

```csharp
Face2 IGetNextFace(
   out Face2 FromFace1Disp,
   out Face2 FromFace2Disp,
   out System.double Thickness
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Face2^ IGetNextFace(
   [Out] Face2^ FromFace1Disp,
   [Out] Face2^ FromFace2Disp,
   [Out] System.double Thickness
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `FromFace1Disp`: [Face](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFace2.html)

on the original part body used in generating the neutral face
- `FromFace2Disp`: [Face](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFace2.html)

on the original part body used in generating the neutral face
- `Thickness`: Distance between the two parallel faces, FromFace1Disp and FromFace2Disp

### Return Value

[Face](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFace2.html)

in this midsurface feature

## VBA Syntax

See

[MidSurface2::IGetNextFace](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~MidSurface2~IGetNextFace.html)

.

## Remarks

Call[IMidSurface2::IGetFirstFace](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IMidSurface2~IGetFirstFace.html)before calling this method to get the first neutral face.

This method returns the next neutral face in this midsurface feature along with three other items.

- The first two return values are the two faces from the original part body that were used to generate this neutral midsurface face.
- The next return value is the thickness (in meters) between the two parallel faces from the original part body.
- The last return value is the neutral face in this midsurface feature.
