.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function ICreateRevolutionSurfaceDLL( _
   ByVal ProfileCurve As Curve, _
   ByRef AxisPoint As System.Double, _
   ByRef AxisDirection As System.Double, _
   ByRef ProfileEndPtParams As System.Double _
) As Surface
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IBody
Dim ProfileCurve As Curve
Dim AxisPoint As System.Double
Dim AxisDirection As System.Double
Dim ProfileEndPtParams As System.Double
Dim value As Surface

value = instance.ICreateRevolutionSurfaceDLL(ProfileCurve, AxisPoint, AxisDirection, ProfileEndPtParams)
```

### C#

```csharp
Surface ICreateRevolutionSurfaceDLL(
   Curve ProfileCurve,
   ref System.double AxisPoint,
   ref System.double AxisDirection,
   ref System.double ProfileEndPtParams
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Surface^ ICreateRevolutionSurfaceDLL(
   Curve^ ProfileCurve,
   System.double% AxisPoint,
   System.double% AxisDirection,
   System.double% ProfileEndPtParams
)
```
