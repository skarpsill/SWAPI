# IMakeIsoCurves Method (ISurface)

Creates curves on a surface.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IMakeIsoCurves( _
   ByRef UvRange As System.Double, _
   ByRef Dir As System.Double, _
   ByVal Angle As System.Double, _
   ByVal Tol As System.Double, _
   ByVal CurveCount As System.Integer, _
   ByRef Curves As Curve, _
   ByRef CurveBounds As System.Double _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISurface
Dim UvRange As System.Double
Dim Dir As System.Double
Dim Angle As System.Double
Dim Tol As System.Double
Dim CurveCount As System.Integer
Dim Curves As Curve
Dim CurveBounds As System.Double
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.IMakeIsoCurves(UvRange, Dir, Angle, Tol, CurveCount, Curves, CurveBounds)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool IMakeIsoCurves(
   ref System.double UvRange,
   ref System.double Dir,
   System.double Angle,
   System.double Tol,
   System.int CurveCount,
   out Curve Curves,
   out System.double CurveBounds
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool IMakeIsoCurves(
   System.double% UvRange,
   System.double% Dir,
   System.double Angle,
   System.double Tol,
   System.int CurveCount,
   [Out] Curve^ Curves,
   [Out] System.double CurveBounds
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `UvRange`: Array of 4 doubles indicating the range of the surface to use (see

Remarks

)
- `Dir`: Array of 3 doubles indicating the direction of projection on the surface (seeRemarks)
- `Angle`: Angle relative to dir where to create the curves
- `Tol`: Tolerance of the curves
- `CurveCount`: Number of curves to create (see

Remarks

)
- `Curves`: Array of

[curves](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ICurve.html)

of size CurveCount
- `CurveBounds`: Array of doubles of size 2*Curves indicating the parametric bounds of the curve

ParamDesc

### Return Value

True if curves are created on the surface, false if not

ParamDesc

## VBA Syntax

See

[Surface::IMakeIsoCurves](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Surface~IMakeIsoCurves.html)

.

## Remarks

The UvRange argument is an array of 4 doubles indicating the minimum and maximum U and V values:

[u_min, u_max, v_min, v_max]

The dir argument is an array of 3 doubles representing the unit vector:

[x, y, z]

Before calling this method, call[ISurface::IGetMakeIsoCurvesCount](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISurface~IGetMakeIsoCurvesCount.html).
