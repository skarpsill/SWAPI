# Crop Drawing View Using Jagged Outline Example (VBA)

This example shows how to crop a drawing view using a jagged outline with the
least shape intensity.

```
'----------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions: Verify that the drawing to open exists.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Opens the drawing.
' 2. Selects and activates Drawing View1 on Sheet1.
' 3. Creates a rectangle.
' 4. Crops Drawing View1 around the rectangle.
' 5. Examine the drawing.
'
' NOTE: Because the drawing is used elsewhere, do not save changes.
