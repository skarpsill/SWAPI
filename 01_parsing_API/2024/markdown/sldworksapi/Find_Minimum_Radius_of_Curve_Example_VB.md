# Find Minimum Radius of Curve (VBA)

This example shows how to get the minimum radius of the selected curve.

```vb
'----------------------------------
' Preconditions: Model kadov_tag{{<spaces>}} kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}document is open and a curve
' kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}               kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}on a part is selected.
'
' Postconditions: None
'----------------------------------
Option Explicit

Dim param(1) As Double
Dim isClose As Boolean
Dim isPeriodic As Boolean
Dim retPar As Boolean

Sub main()

Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
Set swDoc = swApp.ActiveDoc

' Get the selected curve

status = swCurve.FindMinimumRadius(BoundSuf, numOfRadius, radius, location, uvparameter)

'Assume that numOfRadius output is 1

Debug.Print ("Radius")
Debug.Print (radius(0))

Set locationDisp1 = location(0)
arrayData1 = locationDisp1.ArrayData

Debug.Print ("Location")
