Sub SetReverseOffset( _
   ByVal Fwd As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal ValIn As System.Boolean _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IExtrudeFeatureData2
Dim Fwd As System.Boolean
Dim ValIn As System.Boolean

instance.SetReverseOffset(Fwd, ValIn)
```

### C#

```csharp
void SetReverseOffset(
   System.bool Fwd,
   System.bool ValIn
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void SetReverseOffset(
   System.bool Fwd,
   System.bool ValIn
)
```

NOTE:

.

### Parameters

- `Fwd`: True sets the reverse offset setting in the forward direction, false sets it in the reverse direction
- `ValIn`: True enables the reverse offset setting, false disables it
