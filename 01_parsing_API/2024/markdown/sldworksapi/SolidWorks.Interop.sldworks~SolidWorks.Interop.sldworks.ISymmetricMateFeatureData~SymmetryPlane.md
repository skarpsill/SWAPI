# SymmetryPlane Property (ISymmetricMateFeatureData)

Gets or sets the symmetry plane of this symmetry mate.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property SymmetryPlane As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISymmetricMateFeatureData
Dim value As System.Object

instance.SymmetryPlane = value

value = instance.SymmetryPlane
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object SymmetryPlane {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.Object^ SymmetryPlane {
   System.Object^ get();
   void set (    System.Object^ value);
}
```
