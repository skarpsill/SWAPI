# RepairMissingReferences Method (ISimpleFilletFeatureData2)

Finds missing references in this fillet/chamfer and reassigns them to new edges.

## Syntax

instance.RepairMissingReferences()
```

### C#

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

## VBA Syntax

See

[SimpleFilletFeatureData2::RepairMissingReferences](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~SimpleFilletFeatureData2~RepairMissingReferences.html)

.

## Remarks

If you delete a feature that this fillet or chamfer is referencing and then create a similar feature with the same geometry, the references do not reattach. The missing references appear in the

Items To Fillet

list box of the Fillet PropertyManager, but finding the valid edges to reattach is difficult. Call this method to find all missing references and reassign them to new edges.
