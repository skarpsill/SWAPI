## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function CreateBlockDefinition( _
   ByVal Name As System.String, _
   ByVal XRefFileName As System.String, _
   ByVal Instance As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal Segments As System.Object, _
   ByVal Points As System.Object, _
   ByVal Notes As System.Object, _
   ByVal Dimensions As System.Object, _

Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.CreateBlockDefinition(Name, XRefFileName, Instance, Segments, Points, Notes, Dimensions, Blocks)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object CreateBlockDefinition(
   System.string Name,
