.

Array of related bodies

## VBA Syntax

See

[PartDoc::GetRelatedBodies](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~PartDoc~GetRelatedBodies.html)

.

## Remarks

The list contains only those bodies associated with reference surfaces. What results is a list of bodies, which is related to the model, but it does not include the part body itself.

A reference surface feature can consist of one or more surfaces knitted together. Each reference surface feature has two[IBody2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IBody2.html)objects:

- One for the front faces
- One for the back faces

Each IBody2 object has one or more faces depending on whether the reference surface feature is a set of knitted surfaces or a single underlying surface. The corresponding faces for each body pair should have normal vectors that are opposite.
