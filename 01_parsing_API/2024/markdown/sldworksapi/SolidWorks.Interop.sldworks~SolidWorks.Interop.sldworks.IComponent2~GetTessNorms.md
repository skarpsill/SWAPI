# GetTessNorms Method (IComponent2)

Gets the normal vector for each of the triangles, which make up the shaded picture tessellation for the component.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetTessNorms() As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IComponent2
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.GetTessNorms()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object GetTessNorms()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ GetTessNorms();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

Object of type SafeArray of floats (see**Remarks**)

## VBA Syntax

See

[Component2::GetTessNorms](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Component2~GetTessNorms.html)

.

## Remarks

Tessellation information is available only when the component is loaded as lightweight.

The format of retval is:

- float x, y, z - first point's unit normal
- float x, y, z - second point's unit normal
- float x, y, z - third point's unit normal

for the set of triangles for the component.

The total size of the data is[9 x sizeof(float) x (number of triangles)].
