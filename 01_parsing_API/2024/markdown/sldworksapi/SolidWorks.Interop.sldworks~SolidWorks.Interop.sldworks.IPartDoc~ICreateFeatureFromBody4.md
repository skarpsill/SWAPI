# ICreateFeatureFromBody4 Method (IPartDoc)

Creates a new imported feature from the specified temporary body.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function ICreateFeatureFromBody4( _
   ByVal Body As Body2, _
   ByVal MakeRefSurface As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal Options As System.Integer _
) As Feature
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IPartDoc
Dim Body As Body2
Dim MakeRefSurface As System.Boolean
Dim Options As System.Integer
Dim value As Feature

value = instance.ICreateFeatureFromBody4(Body, MakeRefSurface, Options)
```

### C#

```csharp
Feature ICreateFeatureFromBody4(
   Body2 Body,
   System.bool MakeRefSurface,
   System.int Options
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Feature^ ICreateFeatureFromBody4(
   Body2^ Body,
   System.bool MakeRefSurface,
   System.int Options
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Body`: Temporary

[body](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IBody2.html)
- `MakeRefSurface`: If the body cannot be knit to a solid or if a solid body already exists in this model, then True creates of a reference surface feature
- `Options`: Option as defined by[swCreateFeatureBodyOpts_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swCreateFeatureBodyOpts_e.html)

### Return Value

Newly created imported

[feature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature.html)

or NULL if the operation fails

## VBA Syntax

See

[PartDoc::ICreateFeatureFromBody4](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~PartDoc~ICreateFeatureFromBody4.html)

.

## Remarks

This method:

- Is intended as the final call in a knitting operation. The body that results from your knitting efforts can be converted into an imported body feature in the SOLIDWORKS model.
- Is not limited to[IBody2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IBody2.html)objects obtained from knitting operations.
- Allows the application to decide how much additional work must be done to the model before creating the feature. The options listed in the swCreateFeatureBodyOpts_e enumeration can be OR'd together to provide additional checking or simplification of the model. If you specify swCreateFeatureBodySimplify for Options, then swCreateFeatureBodyCheck is implied.

If the application passes 0 for the options argument, then the options are disabled and the model is passed without any checking. It is up to the application to ensure that the model is a valid model.

If this method fails, the error might be caused by creating a sheet (surface) body from a multiple shells body. If so, replace this method with[IPartDoc::CreateSurfaceFeatureFromBody](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IPartDoc~CreateSurfaceFeatureFromBody.html)and[IPartDoc::ICreateSurfaceFeatureFromBodyCount2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IPartDoc~ICreateSurfaceFeatureFromBodyCount2.html).
