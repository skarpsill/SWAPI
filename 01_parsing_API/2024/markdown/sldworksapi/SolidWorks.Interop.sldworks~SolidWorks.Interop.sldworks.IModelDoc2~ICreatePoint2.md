# ICreatePoint2 Method (IModelDoc2)

Obsolete. Superseded by

[ISketchManager::CreatePoint](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchManager~CreatePoint.html)

.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function ICreatePoint2( _
   ByVal PointX As System.Double, _
   ByVal PointY As System.Double, _
   ByVal PointZ As System.Double _
) As SketchPoint
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IModelDoc2
Dim PointX As System.Double
Dim PointY As System.Double
Dim PointZ As System.Double
Dim value As SketchPoint

value = instance.ICreatePoint2(PointX, PointY, PointZ)
```

### C#

```csharp
SketchPoint ICreatePoint2(
   System.double PointX,
   System.double PointY,
   System.double PointZ
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
SketchPoint^ ICreatePoint2(
   System.double PointX,
   System.double PointY,
   System.double PointZ
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `PointX`: X location of the point
- `PointY`: Y location of the point
- `PointZ`: Z location of the point; ignored for 2D sketches

### Return Value

Newly created

[sketch point](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchPoint.html)

; this value is NULL if the operation fails

## VBA Syntax

See

[ModelDoc2::ICreatePoint2](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~ModelDoc2~ICreatePoint2.html)

.

## Remarks

This method creates a point in the active 2D or 3D sketch. If a sketch is not active, the point is not created and NULL is returned. Use[IModelDoc2::GetActiveSketch2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~GetActiveSketch2.html)or[IModelDoc2::IGetActiveSketch2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~IGetActiveSketch2.html)to check to see if the sketch is active.

[IModelDoc2::SetAddToDB](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~SetAddToDB.html)and[IModelDoc2::SetDisplayWhenAdded](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~SetDisplayWhenAdded.html)increase performance during entity creation by adding entities directly to the SOLIDWORKS database. IModelDoc2::SetAddToDB also avoids inferencing.
