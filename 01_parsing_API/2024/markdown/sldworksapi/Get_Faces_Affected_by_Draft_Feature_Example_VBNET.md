# Get Faces Affected by Draft Feature Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to get the faces affected by a draft feature.

**NOTE:**In SOLIDWORKS, a feature is comprised
of faces. The faces created by a feature can be
retrieved using IFeature::GetFaces. However, certain types
of features only affect existing faces and do not
create any new faces. Examples of these types of features are
draft and scale features. For these features, IFeature::GetFaces
returns an empty array (no faces). This sample code shows how to use
IDraftFeatureData2::GetDraftedEntities to get the faces affected by a draft
feature.

```vb
 '---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
 ' 1. Open a part or assembly with a draft feature.
 ' 2. If you opened an assembly, then fully resolve the assembly if necessary.
 ' 3. Select a draft feature.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1. Deselects the draft feature.
 ' 2. Selects the faces affected by the draft feature.
 ' 3. Gets the type of draft feature as defined in swDraftFeature_e.
 ' 4. Examine the Immediate window and graphics area.
