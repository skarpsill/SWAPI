# GetEdgeCount Method (IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData)

Gets the number of edges that form a closed loop.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetEdgeCount() As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData
Dim value As System.Integer

value = instance.GetEdgeCount()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int GetEdgeCount()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.int GetEdgeCount();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

Number of edges

## VBA Syntax

See

[ShutOffSurfaceFeatureData::GetEdgeCount](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~ShutOffSurfaceFeatureData~GetEdgeCount.html)

.

## Examples

See

[IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData.html)

examples.

## Remarks

Call this method before calling[IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData::IGetEdges](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData~IGetEdges.html)to get the size of the array for that method.
