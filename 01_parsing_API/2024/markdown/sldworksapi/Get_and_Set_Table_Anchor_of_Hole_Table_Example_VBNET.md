# Get and Set Table Anchor of Hole Table Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to get and set the table anchor of a hole table in a
drawing.

```vb
 '-----------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions: Verify that the specified drawing to open exists.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1. Opens the drawing.
 ' 2. At Stop, examine the position of the hole table
 '    in the drawing.
 ' 2. Click the Continue button in the SOLIDWORKS Visual Studio Tools for
 '    Applications IDE.
 ' 4. Sets the position of the hole table's anchor
 '    to the specified location.
 ' 5. Examine the hole table in the drawing.
 '
 ' NOTE: If prompted, do not save changes when closing the drawing.
