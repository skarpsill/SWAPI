# IGetFaceArray Method (IProjectionCurveFeatureData)

Gets a list of target faces for the projected curve.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetFaceArray( _
   ByVal FaceCount As System.Integer _
) As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IProjectionCurveFeatureData
Dim FaceCount As System.Integer
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.IGetFaceArray(FaceCount)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object IGetFaceArray(
   System.int FaceCount
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ IGetFaceArray(
   System.int FaceCount
)
```

NOTE:

See

.

### Parameters

- `FaceCount`: Number of target faces

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of target faces of size FaceCount

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported
