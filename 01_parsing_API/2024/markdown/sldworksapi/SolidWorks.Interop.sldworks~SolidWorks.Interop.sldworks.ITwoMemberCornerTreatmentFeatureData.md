## Remarks

This interface is:

- derived from

  [ICornerTreatmentFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ICornerTreatmentFeatureData.html)

  .
- valid only if

  [ICornerTreatmentFeatureData::IgnoreCornerTreatment](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ICornerTreatmentFeatureData~IgnoreCornerTreatment.html)

  is false.

A two member corner is the position in a structure system where two members intersect. You can assign one member as a trim tool and use it to add or remove material from the other member. The trim tool member may be assigned to either member in a planar or body trim type.

In the SOLIDWORKS user interface, the Two member Corner PropertyManager contains three lists that you can manage using the APIs in this interface and elsewhere:

- [Corner groups](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ICornerTreatmentGroupFolder~GetCornerTreatments.html)
- [Corner group members](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ITwoMemberCornerTreatmentFeatureData~GetCornerGroupMembers.html)
- [Miter trim plane point](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ITwoMemberCornerTreatmentFeatureData~MiterTrimPlanePoint.html)
