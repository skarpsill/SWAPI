### Return Value

[Feature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature.html)

## VBA Syntax

See

[FeatureManager::FeatureFillPattern](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~FeatureManager~FeatureFillPattern.html)

.

## Remarks

**Insert > Pattern/Mirror > Fill Pattern**in the SOLIDWORKS menu opens the Fill Pattern PropertyManager. The parameters in this method correspond to the options in the Fill Pattern PropertyManager.

For all pattern layouts except[swPatternLayoutType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swPatternLayoutType_e.html).swPatternLayoutPerforation, the fill pattern is created by positioning a pattern seed instance within the fill boundary and copying the pattern in concentric loops about the seed instance.

See the SOLIDWORKS Help for more information about fill pattern features.

To create a fill pattern:

1. Use

  [IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~SelectByID2.html)

  or another selection method to select the entities required to create a fill pattern feature.

| Select... | For the Fill Pattern's... | Using Mark... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sketch, face, planar curve on a face, or coplanar faces | Fill boundary | 1 |
| Direction reference (e.g., edge or axis) | Pattern direction (if not selected, SOLIDWORKS chooses a direction reference appropriate for the specified layout) | 2 |
| Vertex or sketch point | Location of the pattern seed instance (if a point is not selected, the pattern seed instance is placed at the center of the fill boundary region) | 3 |
| Features | Pattern objects | 4 |
| Faces | Pattern objects | 5 |
| Bodies | Pattern objects | 6 |

1. Call this method, specifying the following parameters:

- PatternLayoutType
- LayoutSpacingType
- FeaturesToPatternType
- GeometryPattern
- LoopSpacing (for all PatternLayoutTypes except swPatternLayoutType_e.swPatternLayoutPerforation)

Depending on the settings above, other parameters might need to be specified.
