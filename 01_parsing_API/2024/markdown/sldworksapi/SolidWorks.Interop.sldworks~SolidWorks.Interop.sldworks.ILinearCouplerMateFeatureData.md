## Remarks

SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IMateFeatureData.html

A linear/linear coupler mate establishes a relationship between the translation of one component and the translation of another component.

[IMateFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IMateFeatureData.html)is the parent of this advanced mate interface.

To create a linear/linear coupler mate:

1. Follow general instructions in the

  [IAssemblyDoc::CreateMate](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IAssemblyDoc~CreateMate.html)

  Remarks.
2. Specify

  [ILinearCouplerMateFeatureData::MateEntity1](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ILinearCouplerMateFeatureData~MateEntity1.html)

  and

  [ILinearCouplerMateFeatureData::MateEntity2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ILinearCouplerMateFeatureData~MateEntity2.html)

  .
3. Specify other properties of the LinearCouplerMateFeatureData object as required.

To edit a linear/linear coupler mate:

1. Access its feature and call

  [IFeature::GetDefinition](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetDefinition.html)

  to get the MateFeatureData object.
2. Cast the MateFeatureData object to a LinearCouplerMateFeatureData object.
3. Modify the LinearCouplerMateFeatureData object.
4. Call

  [IFeature::ModifyDefinition](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html)

  .

To delete a linear/linear coupler mate, use[IModelDocExtension::DeleteSelection2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~DeleteSelection2.html).
