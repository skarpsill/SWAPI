# DModelViewEvents_BufferSwapNotifyEventHandler Delegate (SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks)

Fired from the model view immediately before the buffers are swapped when rendering shaded graphics in OpenGL.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Public Delegate Function DModelViewEvents_BufferSwapNotifyEventHandler() As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As New DModelViewEvents_BufferSwapNotifyEventHandler(AddressOf HandlerMethod)
```

### C#

```csharp
public delegate System.int DModelViewEvents_BufferSwapNotifyEventHandler()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
public delegate System.int DModelViewEvents_BufferSwapNotifyEventHandler();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

## VBA Syntax

See

[BufferSwapNotify Event (ModelView)](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/SldWorks~ModelView~BufferSwapNotify_EV.html)

.

## Remarks

The OpenGL context contains matrices such that graphics are drawn correctly relative to the part or top-level assembly, but not any components within the assembly. This event is also sent when the model is in HLR or HLV mode and being dynamically rotated.

This eventkadov_tag{{</spaces>}}is sent for any other wireframe repainting. (GDI is used for all other wireframe painting). You can determine if a model is shaded by using[IModelView::GetDisplayState](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelView~GetDisplayState.html).

This event is fired after rendering to Layer0.

**NOTE:**When SOLIDWORKS renders to a frame, it renders two layers:

[RenderLayer0Notify](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.DModelViewEvents_RenderLayer0NotifyEventHandler.html)is fired when SOLIDWORKS renders to Layer0, depending on optimization.[GraphicsRenderPostNotify](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.DModelViewEvents_GraphicsRenderPostNotifyEventHandler.html)is always fired after rendering to Layer2.

If developing a C++ application, use[swViewBufferSwapNotify](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swViewNotify_e.html)to register for this notification.
