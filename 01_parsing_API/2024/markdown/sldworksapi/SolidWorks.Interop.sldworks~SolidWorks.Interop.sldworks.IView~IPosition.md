Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

See

[View::IPosition](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~View~IPosition.html)

.

## Remarks

Any view alignments that might affect this view are handled the same way as if you were using the SOLIDWORKS user interface to draw the view to move it. If it is aligned with another view, it will only be allowed to move along the alignment vector. If it has child views that are aligned with it, those views will also be moved along with this view.

Changing this property can cause changes to the graphics of the drawing. After making all the view-related changes, call[IModelDoc2::EditRebuild3](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~EditRebuild3.html)to regenerate the drawing to see these changes.
