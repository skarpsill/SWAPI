NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `FieldId`: Identifier for field as defined in[swSummInfoField_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swSummInfoField_e.html)

### Property Value

Text in field

## VBA Syntax

See

[ModelDoc2::SummaryInfo](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~ModelDoc2~SummaryInfo.html)

.

## Examples

[Get File Summary Information (VBA)](Get_File_Summary_Information_Example_VB.htm)

## Remarks

In line with Microsoft recommendations for OLE support, the file summary information for SOLIDWORKS documents is written as an OLE property set into a stream named "\005Summary Information" off the root storage of the SOLIDWORKS document's compound file.

NOTES:

- MFC does not currently provide classes that manage summary information. However, the DRAWCLI application shipped with Visual C++ does include a sample implementation, in the form of the class CSummInfo, which you can use as an example when implementing your own. This class is used by the document class CDrawDoc. DRAWCLI also includes property pages for displaying and modifying Summary Information.
- Some dates are localized.

Option Explicit

Sub main()

Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks

Dim swModel As SldWorks.ModelDoc2

Dim Text1 As String

Dim Text2 As String

Dim Text3 As String

Dim Text4 As String

Set swApp = CreateObject("SldWorks.Application")

Set swModel = swApp.ActiveDoc

' All of these date strings will be localized according to

' the current regional settings

' These two dates (day, month, and year)

' will be in numeric format and localized

Text1 = swModel.SummaryInfo(swSumInfoCreateDate)

Text2 = swModel.SummaryInfo(swSumInfoSaveDate)

' These two dates will be the same as displayed in the

' File, Properties menu in text format

Text3 = swModel.SummaryInfo(swSumInfoCreateDate2)

Text4 = swModel.SummaryInfo(swSumInfoSaveDate2)

Debug.Print "CreateDate = " + Text1

Debug.Print "SaveDate = " + Text2

Debug.Print "CreateDate2 = " + Text3

Debug.Print "SaveDate2 = " + Text4

End Sub
