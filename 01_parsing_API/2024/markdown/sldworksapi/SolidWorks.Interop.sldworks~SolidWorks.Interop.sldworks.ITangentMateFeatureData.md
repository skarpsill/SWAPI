## Remarks

A tangent mate:

- Places selected items tangent to one another.
- Must have at least one cylindrical, conical, or spherical item.

[IMateFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IMateFeatureData.html)is the parent of this mate interface.

To create a tangent mate:

1. Follow general instructions in the

  [IAssemblyDoc::CreateMate](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IAssemblyDoc~CreateMate.html)

  Remarks.
2. Specify

  [ITangentMateFeatureData::EntitiesToMate](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ITangentMateFeatureData~EntitiesToMate.html)

  or use

  [IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~SelectByID2.html)

  to pre-select the entities to mate using Mark = 1.
3. Specify other properties of the TangentMateFeatureData object.

To edit a tangent mate:

1. Access its feature and call

  [IFeature::GetDefinition](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetDefinition.html)

  to get the MateFeatureData object.
2. Cast the MateFeatureData object to a TangentMateFeatureData object.
3. Modify the TangentMateFeatureData object.
4. Call

  [IFeature::ModifyDefinition](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html)

  .

To delete this tangent mate, use[IModelDocExtension::DeleteSelection2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~DeleteSelection2.html).
