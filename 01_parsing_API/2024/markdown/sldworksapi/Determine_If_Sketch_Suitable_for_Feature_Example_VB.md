# Determine if Sketch Suitable for Feature Example (VBA)

This example shows how to determine if a sketch is suitable for use
in a feature.

**NOTE:**kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}Sketch
geometry can be used in a variety of ways in SOLIDWORKS.kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}However,
not every sketch is suitable for every purpose.kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}For
example, (non-thin) extrusions require a closed profile.

```
'------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open a part or assembly.
' 2. Select a sketch.
' 3. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Checks the selected sketch.
' 2. Examine the Immediate window.
