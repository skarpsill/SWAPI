# GetProjectionLines Method (IView)

Gets the projection lines (arrows) in this drawing view.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetProjectionLines() As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IView
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.GetProjectionLines()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object GetProjectionLines()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ GetProjectionLines();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

Array of

[projection lines](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IProjectionArrow.html)

## VBA Syntax

See

[View::GetProjectionLines](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~View~GetProjectionLines.html)

.

## Remarks

This method only works for base drawing views; it does not work for projected or auxiliary views.

Multiple projection lines can exist in a view. This method returns the interface for each projection line so that an application such as DXF/DWG translation can create the projection lines with the base drawing view rather than creating those lines when cycling through the views and finding a projected or auxiliary view.
