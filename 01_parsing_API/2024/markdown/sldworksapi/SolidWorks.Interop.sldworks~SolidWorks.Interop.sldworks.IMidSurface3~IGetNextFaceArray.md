# IGetNextFaceArray Method (IMidSurface3)

Gets the next face from the original paired faces and the thickness between the faces.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetNextFaceArray( _
   ByRef FromFrontFaceListDisp As Face2, _
   ByRef SizeOfFrontFaceList As System.Integer, _
   ByRef FromFaceBackListDisp As Face2, _
   ByRef SizeOfBackFaceList As System.Integer, _
   ByRef Thickness As System.Double _
) As Face2
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IMidSurface3
Dim FromFrontFaceListDisp As Face2
Dim SizeOfFrontFaceList As System.Integer
Dim FromFaceBackListDisp As Face2
Dim SizeOfBackFaceList As System.Integer
Dim Thickness As System.Double
Dim value As Face2

value = instance.IGetNextFaceArray(FromFrontFaceListDisp, SizeOfFrontFaceList, FromFaceBackListDisp, SizeOfBackFaceList, Thickness)
```

### C#

```csharp
Face2 IGetNextFaceArray(
   out Face2 FromFrontFaceListDisp,
   out System.int SizeOfFrontFaceList,
   out Face2 FromFaceBackListDisp,
   out System.int SizeOfBackFaceList,
   out System.double Thickness
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Face2^ IGetNextFaceArray(
   [Out] Face2^ FromFrontFaceListDisp,
   [Out] System.int SizeOfFrontFaceList,
   [Out] Face2^ FromFaceBackListDisp,
   [Out] System.int SizeOfBackFaceList,
   [Out] System.double Thickness
)
```

### Parameters

- `FromFrontFaceListDisp`: - in-process,unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of front

  [faces](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFace2.html)

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.
- `SizeOfFrontFaceList`: Number of front faces
- `FromFaceBackListDisp`: - in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of back

  [faces](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFace2.html)

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.
- `SizeOfBackFaceList`: Number of back faces
- `Thickness`: Thickness between the faces

### Return Value

## Remarks

A separator is needed between the front faces and back faces. Thus, a NULL always exists between the front faces and the back faces.

For example, if there are five faces in the model, then the mid-surface has five faces. To get the five faces:

- Call[IMidSurface3::IGetGetFirstFaceArray](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IMidSurface3~IGetFirstFaceArray.html)once.
- Call IMidSurface3::IGetNextFaceArray four times.

At each call, the data is arranged as follows if there is one front face in the array:kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}

[Neutral face],[front face], NULL,[back face]

If there are more than one front face in the array, then the data is arranged as follows:

[Neutral face],[front face1, front face2], NULL,[back face1, back face2]

Call IMidSurface3::IGetFirstFaceArray to get the first face from the original paired faces.
