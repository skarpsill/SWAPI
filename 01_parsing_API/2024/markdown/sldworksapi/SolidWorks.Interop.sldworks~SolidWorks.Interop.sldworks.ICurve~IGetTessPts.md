# IGetTessPts Method (ICurve)

Gets a set of points that represent the tessellation of this curve.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetTessPts( _
   ByVal ChordTolerance As System.Double, _
   ByVal LengthTolerance As System.Double, _
   ByRef StartPoint As System.Double, _
   ByRef EndPoint As System.Double _
) As System.Double
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICurve
Dim ChordTolerance As System.Double
Dim LengthTolerance As System.Double
Dim StartPoint As System.Double
Dim EndPoint As System.Double
Dim value As System.Double

value = instance.IGetTessPts(ChordTolerance, LengthTolerance, StartPoint, EndPoint)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.double IGetTessPts(
   System.double ChordTolerance,
   System.double LengthTolerance,
   ref System.double StartPoint,
   ref System.double EndPoint
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.double IGetTessPts(
   System.double ChordTolerance,
   System.double LengthTolerance,
   System.double% StartPoint,
   System.double% EndPoint
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `ChordTolerance`: Chord tolerance to use in tessellation (meters); this is the maximum permitted distance from a cord to the curve between the cord endpoints; the smallest allowable value for this parameter is 1E-8; if 0.0 or a value smaller than 1E-8 is specified, then 1E-8 is used by default
- `LengthTolerance`: Length tolerance to be used to filter out very short segments (meters); this method does not return tessellated segments shorter than this value
- `StartPoint`: Pointer to an array containing the start point of the curve
- `EndPoint`: Pointer to an array containing the end point of the curve

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array containing the tessellation points (see

  Remarks

  )

- VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

## Remarks

The array returned contains the x, y, z location of the tessellation points:

**[**`x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2,`...**]**

Before calling this method, call[ICurve::IGetTessPtsSize](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ICurve~IGetTessPtsSize.html)to determine the size of the array needed to contain the return values of this method.
