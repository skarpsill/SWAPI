# Get All Sketch Relations and Their Types Example (VBA)

This example shows how to get all of the sketch relations and their
types for the selected sketch.

```
'----------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open a part document.
' 2. Select a sketch.
' 3. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Gets the sketch relations for the selected sketch.
' 2. Examine the Immediate window.
