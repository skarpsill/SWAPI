# IsBase2 Method (IFeature)

Gets whether this feature is a base feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IsBase2() As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeature
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.IsBase2()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool IsBase2()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool IsBase2();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

True if this is a base feature, false if not

## VBA Syntax

See

[Feature::IsBase2](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Feature~IsBase2.html)

.

## Remarks

Any feature that creates a solid body is a base feature. For example:

- An extrude operation creates a solid body; therefore, that feature is a base feature.
- A body imported via an IGES file is a base feature.

However, a fillet operation does not create a solid body; therefore, that feature is not a base feature.

In a multibody environment, more than one feature can return true. Thus, a lot of features can be base features in a multibody environment.
