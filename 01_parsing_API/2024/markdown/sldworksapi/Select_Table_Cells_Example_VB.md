This example shows how to interpret the results of selecting table cells in
various ways.

```
'-----------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. A drawing with a table, which has multiple rows
'    and columns, is open.
' 2. Open the Immediate window.
' 3. Select a column.
' 4. Run the macro.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. The range for all of the cells in the column is
'    printed to the Immediate window. Examine
'    the Immediate window.
' 2. Hold down the Ctrl key and click a cell.
' 3. Repeat step 2 to select additional adjacent cells.
' 4. Run the macro again.
' 5. The range for each selected cell is printed to
'    the Immediate window. Examine the Immediate
'    window.
