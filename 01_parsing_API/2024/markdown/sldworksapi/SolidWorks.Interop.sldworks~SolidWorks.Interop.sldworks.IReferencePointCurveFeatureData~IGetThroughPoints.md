# IGetThroughPoints Method (IReferencePointCurveFeatureData)

Gets the points through which this curve passes.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetThroughPoints( _
   ByVal Count As System.Integer, _
   ByRef Type As System.Integer _
) As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IReferencePointCurveFeatureData
Dim Count As System.Integer
Dim Type As System.Integer
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.IGetThroughPoints(Count, Type)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object IGetThroughPoints(
   System.int Count,
   out System.int Type
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ IGetThroughPoints(
   System.int Count,
   [Out] System.int Type
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Count`: Number of points
- `Type`: Type of entities (sketch points or vertices) as defined by[swSelectType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swSelectType_e.html)

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of points

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.
