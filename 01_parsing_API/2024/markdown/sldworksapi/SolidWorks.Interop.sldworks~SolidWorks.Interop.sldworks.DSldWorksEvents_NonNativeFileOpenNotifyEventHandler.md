   System.string FileName
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
public delegate System.int DSldWorksEvents_NonNativeFileOpenNotifyEventHandler(

.

### Parameters

## VBA Syntax

See

[NonNativeFileOpenNotify Event (SldWorks)](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/SldWorks~SldWorks~NonNativeFileOpenNotify_EV.html)

.

## Remarks

This event occurs after automatic healing if it is enabled. To enable automatic healing, set swImportAutoRunImportDiagnosticsPersist and swImportAutoRunImportDiagnostics to True. See[swUserPreferenceToggle_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swUserPreferenceToggle_e.html), Import for details about these two enumerators.

The file types handled include files with these extensions: .dxf, .dwg, .igs, .sat, .step, .vda, .wrl, and .dll.

On receiving this event, you can call[ISldWorks::ActiveDoc](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~ActiveDoc.html)or[ISldWorks::IActiveDoc2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~IActiveDoc2.html)to get the active[IModelDoc2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2.html)pointer.

In an environment when multiple applications are simultaneously loaded and have access to the SOLIDWORKS application through its APIs, exercise caution when this notification is processed. The active IModelDoc2 may not be the one that corresponds to the FileName argument. For example, this can occur when one of the translator DLL's receives this event and picks up the non-native file and generates a new SOLIDWORKS document. This could happen prior to your application receiving this event.

If developing a C++ application, use[swAppNonNativeFileOpenNotify](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swAppNotify_e.html)to register for this notification.
