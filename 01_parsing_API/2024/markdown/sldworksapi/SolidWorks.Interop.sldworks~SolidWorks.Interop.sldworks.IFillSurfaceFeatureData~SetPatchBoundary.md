Dim instance As IFillSurfaceFeatureData
Dim PatchVar As System.Object
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.SetPatchBoundary(PatchVar)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool SetPatchBoundary(
   System.object PatchVar
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool SetPatchBoundary(
   System.Object^ PatchVar
)
```
