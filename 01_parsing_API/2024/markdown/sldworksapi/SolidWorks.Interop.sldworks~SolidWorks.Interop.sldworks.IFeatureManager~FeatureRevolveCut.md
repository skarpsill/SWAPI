# FeatureRevolveCut Method (IFeatureManager)

Obsolete. Superseded by

[IFeatureManager::FeatureRevolveCut2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~FeatureRevolveCut2.html)

.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function FeatureRevolveCut( _
   ByVal Angle As System.Double, _
   ByVal ReverseDir As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal Angle2 As System.Double, _
   ByVal RevType As System.Integer, _
   ByVal Options As System.Integer, _
   ByVal UseFeatScope As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal UseAutoSelect As System.Boolean _
) As Feature
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeatureManager
Dim Angle As System.Double
Dim ReverseDir As System.Boolean
Dim Angle2 As System.Double
Dim RevType As System.Integer
Dim Options As System.Integer
Dim UseFeatScope As System.Boolean
Dim UseAutoSelect As System.Boolean
Dim value As Feature

value = instance.FeatureRevolveCut(Angle, ReverseDir, Angle2, RevType, Options, UseFeatScope, UseAutoSelect)
```

### C#

```csharp
Feature FeatureRevolveCut(
   System.double Angle,
   System.bool ReverseDir,
   System.double Angle2,
   System.int RevType,
   System.int Options,
   System.bool UseFeatScope,
   System.bool UseAutoSelect
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Feature^ FeatureRevolveCut(
   System.double Angle,
   System.bool ReverseDir,
   System.double Angle2,
   System.int RevType,
   System.int Options,
   System.bool UseFeatScope,
   System.bool UseAutoSelect
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Angle`: Angle of revolution in radians
- `ReverseDir`: True reverses the angle direction, false does not
- `Angle2`: Angle of revolution in radians
- `RevType`: Type of revolution as defined in[swRevolveType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swRevolveType_e.html)(can be either mid-plane or two-direction)
- `Options`: Additional control (see**Remarks**)
- `UseFeatScope`: True if the feature only affects selected bodies, false if the feature affects all bodies
- `UseAutoSelect`: True to automatically select all bodies and have the feature affect those bodies, false to select the bodies the feature affects (seeRemarks)

### Return Value

Pointer to the[IFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature.html)object

## VBA Syntax

See

[FeatureManager::FeatureRevolveCut](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~FeatureManager~FeatureRevolveCut.html)

.

## Examples

[Create Revolve Features (VBA)](Create_Revolve_Features_Example_VB.htm)

## Remarks

The Options argument allows additional control of the feature creation. Supported value isswAutoCloseSketch close the sketch if it is open.

When UseAutoSelect is false, the user must select the bodies that the feature will affect.

When using cut or cavity features that result in multiple bodies, you cannot select to keep all of the resulting bodies or one or more selected bodies.

For extruded feature cuts, see[IFeatureManager::FeatureCut](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~FeatureCut.html).
