### Return Value

Shell type:

- 0 = Open shell. For example, a face that belongs to a sheet (surface) body or reference surface.
- 1 = Internal shell. For example, a face that belongs to a cavity. Face helps define an internal volume.
- 2 = External shell. For example, a typical face on a solid body (helps "hold in" the body mass). This includes all external faces (faces belonging to bosses, pockets, holes, and so on).
