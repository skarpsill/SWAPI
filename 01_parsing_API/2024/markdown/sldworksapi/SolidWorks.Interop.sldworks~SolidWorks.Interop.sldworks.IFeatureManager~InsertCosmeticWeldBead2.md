# InsertCosmeticWeldBead2 Method (IFeatureManager)

Inserts a cosmetic weld bead using either weld geometry or a weld path.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function InsertCosmeticWeldBead2( _
   ByVal WeldMode As System.Integer, _
   ByVal WeldFromFaceOrEdgeSet As System.Object, _
   ByVal WeldToFaceOrEdgeSet As System.Object, _
   ByVal WeldSize As System.Double _
) As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeatureManager
Dim WeldMode As System.Integer
Dim WeldFromFaceOrEdgeSet As System.Object
Dim WeldToFaceOrEdgeSet As System.Object
Dim WeldSize As System.Double
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.InsertCosmeticWeldBead2(WeldMode, WeldFromFaceOrEdgeSet, WeldToFaceOrEdgeSet, WeldSize)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object InsertCosmeticWeldBead2(
   System.int WeldMode,
   System.object WeldFromFaceOrEdgeSet,
   System.object WeldToFaceOrEdgeSet,
   System.double WeldSize
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ InsertCosmeticWeldBead2(
   System.int WeldMode,
   System.Object^ WeldFromFaceOrEdgeSet,
   System.Object^ WeldToFaceOrEdgeSet,
   System.double WeldSize
)
```

NOTE:

Remarks

)
- `WeldToFaceOrEdgeSet`: Array of weld-to entities or Nothing or null (see**Remarks**)
- `WeldSize`: Size of weld bead

### Return Value

Array of weld bead
