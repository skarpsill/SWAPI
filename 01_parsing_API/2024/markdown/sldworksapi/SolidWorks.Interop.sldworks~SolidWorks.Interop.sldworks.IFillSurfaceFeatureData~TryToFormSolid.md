Gets or sets whether to form a solid.

## Syntax

Property TryToFormSolid As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFillSurfaceFeatureData
Dim value As System.Boolean

instance.TryToFormSolid = value

value = instance.TryToFormSolid
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool TryToFormSolid {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.bool TryToFormSolid {
   System.bool get();
   void set (    System.bool value);
}
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Property Value

True if trying to form solid, false if not

## VBA Syntax

See

[FillSurfaceFeatureData::TryToFormSolid](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~FillSurfaceFeatureData~TryToFormSolid.html)

.

## Remarks

The behavior for this option depends on the boundaries.

- When all the boundaries belong to the same solid body, you can use the surface fill to patch the solid.
- If at least one of the edges is an open sheet edge and you merge results, then the fill knits with the surfaces to which the edges belong. See[IFillSurfaceFeatureData::Merge](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFillSurfaceFeatureData~Merge.html)for details about merging results.
- If all the boundary entities are open edges, then a solid may be created.
