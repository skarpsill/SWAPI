# DraftAnalysis Method (IPartingLineFeatureData)

Performs draft analysis for the input angle and the direction of pull.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function DraftAnalysis( _
   ByVal Angle As System.Double _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IPartingLineFeatureData
Dim Angle As System.Double
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.DraftAnalysis(Angle)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool DraftAnalysis(
   System.double Angle
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool DraftAnalysis(
   System.double Angle
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Angle`: Draft angle

### Return Value

True if draft analysis is performed, false if notParamDesc

## VBA Syntax

See

[PartingLineFeatureData::DraftAnalysis](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~PartingLineFeatureData~DraftAnalysis.html)

.

## Remarks

If you want a different pull direction, then use[IPartingLineFeatureData::PullDirectionBase](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IPartingLineFeatureData~PullDirectionBase.html)to change the direction. Once this method is called, only the information for different faces (negative, positive, and so on) is generated.
