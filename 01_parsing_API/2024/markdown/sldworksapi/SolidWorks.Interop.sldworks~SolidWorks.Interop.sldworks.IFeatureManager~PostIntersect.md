# PostIntersect Method (IFeatureManager)

Creates an intersect feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function PostIntersect( _
   ByVal IntersectionsToExclude As System.Object, _
   ByVal Merge As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal Consume As System.Boolean _
) As Feature
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeatureManager
Dim IntersectionsToExclude As System.Object
Dim Merge As System.Boolean
Dim Consume As System.Boolean
Dim value As Feature

value = instance.PostIntersect(IntersectionsToExclude, Merge, Consume)
```

### C#

```csharp
Feature PostIntersect(
   System.object IntersectionsToExclude,
   System.bool Merge,
   System.bool Consume
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Feature^ PostIntersect(
   System.Object^ IntersectionsToExclude,
   System.bool Merge,
   System.bool Consume
)
```

.

### Parameters

- `IntersectionsToExclude`: Array of booleans indicating which bodies returned by

[IFeatureManager::PreIntersect](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~PreIntersect.html)

to exclude from this intersect feature
- `Merge`: True to merge all intersect regions into one body, false to not
- `Consume`: True to remove input surfaces from the FeatureManager design tree, false to not

### Return Value
