# IGetID Method (ISketchPoint)

Gets the sketch point ID for this sketch point.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetID() As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISketchPoint
Dim value As System.Integer

value = instance.IGetID()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int IGetID()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.int IGetID();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

Array with two longs or integers (see[Long vs. Integer](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/overview/Long_vs_Integer.htm)) identifying this sketch point ID

## VBA Syntax

See

[SketchPoint::IGetID](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~SketchPoint~IGetID.html)

.

## Remarks

The ID of the sketch point:

- is an ordered pair (i1, i2). For sketch points, the combination of these two numbers is always unique within a specific sketch.
- cannot be assigned by applications or users.
- is not the same as a

  [persistent reference ID](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/overview/Persistent_Reference_IDs.htm)

  .

Each point within a specific sketch has a unique ID. However, a point and other sketch objects can have the same ID. Likewise, in a second sketch, you may find a different sketch element with the same ID. Therefore, your application must keep track of:

- sketch element type (that is, point, line, arc, spline, and so on)
- owning sketch name
- sketch element ID to uniquely identify a sketched item
