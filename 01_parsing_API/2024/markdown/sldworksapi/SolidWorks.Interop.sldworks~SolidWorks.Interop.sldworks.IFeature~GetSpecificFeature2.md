Dim instance As IFeature
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.GetSpecificFeature2()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object GetSpecificFeature2()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ GetSpecificFeature2();
```

| If... | Then... |
| --- | --- |
| You start with an IFeature object and want to get a more specific object | A call to IFeature::GetSpecificFeature2 is required. If you have the more specific object, then a call to QueryInterface in C++ or an assignment to a IFeature-typed variable allows an application to get back to the IFeature object. |
| You are writing a Dispatch application | You can use IFeature::GetTypeName or IFeature::GetTypeName2 to identify the type of Dispatch object returned so that you can call the appropriate properties and methods for that object. |
| You are writing a COM application | You can use the return value with QueryInterface to determine the object returned. |
| No interface exists or there is no specific object for the type of feature | This method returns Nothing or null. |

For some feature types, this method returns Nothing or null because there is no specific object for that type of feature (e.g., features such as extrusions, lofts, fillets, chamfers, etc.). For these types of features, call[IFeature::GetDefinition](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetDefinition.html)to get their feature data objects.

For other entities selected in the FeatureManager design tree, you must know its interface in advance and cast the return value of[ISelectionMgr::GetSelectedObject6](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISelectionMgr~GetSelectedObject6.html)to the correct interface.

For all functions that return objects, always check whether the return value is Nothing or null before you try to use it.
