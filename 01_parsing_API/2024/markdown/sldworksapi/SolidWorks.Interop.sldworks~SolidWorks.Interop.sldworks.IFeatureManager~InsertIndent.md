# InsertIndent Method (IFeatureManager)

Inserts an indent feature using a selected target body and tool body regions.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function InsertIndent( _
   ByVal Thickness As System.Double, _
   ByVal Clearance As System.Double, _
   ByVal Exclude As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal ClrDir As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal Cut As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal CutDir As System.Boolean _
) As Feature
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeatureManager
Dim Thickness As System.Double
Dim Clearance As System.Double
Dim Exclude As System.Boolean
Dim ClrDir As System.Boolean
Dim Cut As System.Boolean
Dim CutDir As System.Boolean
Dim value As Feature

value = instance.InsertIndent(Thickness, Clearance, Exclude, ClrDir, Cut, CutDir)
```

### C#

```csharp
Feature InsertIndent(
   System.double Thickness,
   System.double Clearance,
   System.bool Exclude,
   System.bool ClrDir,
   System.bool Cut,
   System.bool CutDir
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Feature^ InsertIndent(
   System.double Thickness,
   System.double Clearance,
   System.bool Exclude,
   System.bool ClrDir,
   System.bool Cut,
   System.bool CutDir
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

### Parameters

- `Thickness`: Thickness of the indent feature
- `Clearance`: Distance between the tool body and target body (see

Remarks

)
- `Exclude`: True to exclude the selections, false to include the selections
- `ClrDir`: True to leave the direction of clearance as is, false to reverse the direction of the clearance
- `Cut`: True to cut the target body, false to not
