# CreateLinearDim4 Method (IDrawingDoc)

Creates a non-associative linear dimension.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function CreateLinearDim4( _
   ByVal P0 As System.Object, _
   ByVal P1 As System.Object, _
   ByVal P2 As System.Object, _
   ByVal P3 As System.Object, _
   ByVal P4 As System.Object, _
   ByVal TextPoint As System.Object, _
   ByVal Val As System.Double, _
   ByVal Angle As System.Double, _
   ByVal TextHeight As System.Double _
) As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IDrawingDoc
Dim P0 As System.Object
Dim P1 As System.Object
Dim P2 As System.Object
Dim P3 As System.Object
Dim P4 As System.Object
Dim TextPoint As System.Object
Dim Val As System.Double
Dim Angle As System.Double
Dim TextHeight As System.Double
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.CreateLinearDim4(P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, TextPoint, Val, Angle, TextHeight)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object CreateLinearDim4(
   System.object P0,
   System.object P1,
   System.object P2,
   System.object P3,
   System.object P4,
   System.object TextPoint,
   System.double Val,
   System.double Angle,
   System.double TextHeight
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ CreateLinearDim4(
   System.Object^ P0,
   System.Object^ P1,
   System.Object^ P2,
   System.Object^ P3,
   System.Object^ P4,
   System.Object^ TextPoint,
   System.double Val,
   System.double Angle,
   System.double TextHeight
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `P0`: Array of 3 doubles (x,y,z), dimension point
- `P1`: Array of 3 doubles (x,y,z), dimension end
- `P2`: Array of 3 doubles (x,y,z), normal to the plane of sketch
- `P3`: Array of 3 doubles (x,y,z), extension line 1 reference point
- `P4`: Array of 3 doubles (x,y,z), extension line 2 reference point
- `TextPoint`: Array of 3 doubles (x,y,z), position of text
- `Val`: Value for the non-associative linear dimension
- `Angle`: Inclination angle of the text in radians
- `TextHeight`: Text height in meters

### Return Value

Display dimension

## VBA Syntax

See

[DrawingDoc::CreateLinearDim4](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~DrawingDoc~CreateLinearDim4.html)

.

## Remarks

SOLIDWORKS creates this type of dimension between the two specified points. The dimension is not related to the geometry.
