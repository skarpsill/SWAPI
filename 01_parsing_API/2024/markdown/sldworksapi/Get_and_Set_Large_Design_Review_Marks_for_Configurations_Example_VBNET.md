# Get and Set Large Design Review Marks for Configurations Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to get and set the Large Design Review marks for all of
the configurations in an assembly.

```
'---------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open public_documents\samples\tutorial\driveworksxpress\mobile gantry.sldasm.
' 2. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Gets the current Large Design Review marks for all configurations.
' 2. Sets the Large Design Review marks for all configurations to true.
' 3. Gets the modified Large Design Review marks for all configurations.
' 4. Examine the Immediate window.
'
' NOTE: Because the assembly is used elsewhere, do not save changes.
