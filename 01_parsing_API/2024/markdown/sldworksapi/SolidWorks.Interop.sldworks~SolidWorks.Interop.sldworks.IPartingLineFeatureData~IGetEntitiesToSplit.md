# IGetEntitiesToSplit Method (IPartingLineFeatureData)

Gets the entities that are used to split a face.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetEntitiesToSplit( _
   ByVal Count As System.Integer, _
   ByRef TypeArr As System.Integer _
) As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IPartingLineFeatureData
Dim Count As System.Integer
Dim TypeArr As System.Integer
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.IGetEntitiesToSplit(Count, TypeArr)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object IGetEntitiesToSplit(
   System.int Count,
   out System.int TypeArr
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ IGetEntitiesToSplit(
   System.int Count,
   [Out] System.int TypeArr
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Count`: Number of entities
- `TypeArr`: - in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of these entities as defined in

  [swSelectType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swSelectType_e.html)

  ParamDesc

  :

  - swSelVERTICES
  - swSelSKETCHSEGS
- VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of

  [vertices](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IVertex.html)

  or

## Remarks

The resulting edges are added to the parting line feature.

Call[IPartingLineFeatureData::GetEntitiesToSplitCount](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IPartingLineFeatureData~GetEntitiesToSplitCount.html)before this method.

When two vertices are specified, then an edge is created between them for the parting line feature.

See[Accessing Selections that Define Features](sldworksAPIProgGuide.chm::/Miscellaneous/Accessing_Selections_that_Define_Features.htm)for additional details on using this method.
