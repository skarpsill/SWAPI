```
Option Explicit
```

```
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks
Dim swModel As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
Dim swSelMgr As SldWorks.SelectionMgr
Dim swDispDim As SldWorks.DisplayDimension
Dim swSelObj As Object
Dim selCount As Long
Dim selType As Long
```

```
Sub main()
```

```
    Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
    Set swModel = swApp.ActiveDoc
    Set swSelMgr = swModel.SelectionManager
```

```
    selCount = swSelMgr.GetSelectedObjectCount2(-1)
    If selCount < 1 Then
        Debug.Print "Select a display dimension and rerun the macro."
        Exit Sub
    End If
```

```
    selType = swSelMgr.GetSelectedObjectType3(1, 0)
    Set swSelObj = swSelMgr.GetSelectedObject6(1, 0)
    Select Case selType
        Case swSelDIMENSIONS
            Set swDispDim = swSelObj
            Debug.Print "Was display dimension created in SOLIDWORKS 2011 or later? " & swDispDim.GetSupportsGenericText
    End Select
```

End Sub
