# Get Library Feature Data Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to get data about library features in model
documents.

```vb
 '-------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
 ' 1. Open a model document that contains at least one
 '    library feature.
 ' 2. Open the Immediate window.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1. Traverses the FeatureManager design tree searching for
 '    library features.
 ' 2. Gets each library feature's data.
 ' 3. Inspect the Immediate window.
