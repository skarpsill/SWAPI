 ' Preconditions:
 ' 1. Verify that the specified document exists.
 ' 2. Open the Immediate window.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1. Opens the assembly and gets the FeatureManager
 '    design tree's display-related property values.
 ' 2. Examine both the Immediate window and the FeatureManager
 '    design tree, then press F5.
 ' 3. Re-examine both the Immediate window the
 '    FeatureManager design tree to verify the changes.
