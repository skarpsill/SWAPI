 ' Preconditions:
 ' 1. Open public_documents\samples\tutorial\multibody\multi_local.sldprt.
 ' 2. Open an Immediate window.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1. Creates Body-Delete/Keep 1 in the FeatureManager design tree.
 ' 2. Inspect the Immediate window.

Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks
 Dim Part As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
 Dim myFeature As SldWorks.Feature
 Dim insDelBody As SldWorks.DeleteBodyFeatureData
 Dim boolstatus As Boolean
 Option Explicit
Sub main()
    Set swApp = Application.SldWorks

    Set Part = swApp.ActiveDoc
     ' Select body to delete
     boolstatus = Part.Extension.SelectByID2("Fillet5", "SOLIDBODY", 5.92851881957586E-02, 4.09115950836281E-02, -1.97275812591329E-02, True, 0, Nothing, 0)
     ' Create a Body-Delete/Keep feature
     Set myFeature = Part.FeatureManager.InsertDeleteBody2(False)

    Set insDelBody = myFeature.GetDefinition
     Debug.Print "Number of bodies in this Body-Delete/Keep feature: " & insDelBody.GetBodiesCount
     Debug.Print "Keep bodies: " & insDelBody.KeepBodies
End Sub
