# SetDirectionReference Method (ISimpleHoleFeatureData2)

Sets the direction of the cut extrude for this simple hole feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function SetDirectionReference( _
   ByVal Ref1 As System.Object, _
   ByVal Ref2 As System.Object _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISimpleHoleFeatureData2
Dim Ref1 As System.Object
Dim Ref2 As System.Object
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.SetDirectionReference(Ref1, Ref2)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool SetDirectionReference(
   System.object Ref1,
   System.object Ref2
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool SetDirectionReference(
   System.Object^ Ref1,
   System.Object^ Ref2
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Ref1`: First reference entity (see

Remarks

)
- `Ref2`: Second reference entity (see

Remarks

)

### Return Value

True if the direction for the cut is set, false if not

## VBA Syntax

See

[SimpleHoleFeatureData2::SetDirectionReference](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~SimpleHoleFeatureData2~SetDirectionReference.html)

.

## Remarks

Sometimes one reference entity defines a direction; for example, an edge or axis. Other times, two reference entities define a direction; for example, two vertices or two sketch points.

Valid reference entities for Ref1 and Ref2:

- line segment
- edge
- axis
- vertex
- face
- plane
- sketch point
