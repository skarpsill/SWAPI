# Change Angle to Supplementary Angle Example (VBA)

This example shows how to change the angle in an angular dimension to its
supplementary angle.

```
'-----------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions: Verify that the drawing exists.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Opens the drawing.
' 2. Selects the angular dimension.
' 3. Changes the angle to its supplementary angle.
' 4. Examine the graphics area.
'
' NOTE: Because the drawing is used elsewhere, do not save
' changes.

Dim swDisplayDimension As SldWorks.DisplayDimension
Dim status As Boolean
Dim warnings As Long
Dim errors As Long
Dim fileName As String
