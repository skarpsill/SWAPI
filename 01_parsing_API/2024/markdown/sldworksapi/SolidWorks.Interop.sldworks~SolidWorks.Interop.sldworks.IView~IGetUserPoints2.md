# IGetUserPoints2 Method (IView)

Gets all of the information about all of the user points in this view.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetUserPoints2() As System.Double
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IView
Dim value As System.Double

value = instance.IGetUserPoints2()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.double IGetUserPoints2()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.double IGetUserPoints2();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of doubles (see

  Remarks

  )

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

## Remarks

The return value is the following array of doubles:

[Color, LineStyleIndex, LineWidth, LayerID, LayerOverride, ptLoc[3] ...]

Color= COLORREF returned as an integer. Return value could be 0 or -1 for default color.

LineStyleIndex= line style. Valid line styles can be found in the[swLineStyles_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swLineStyles_e.html)enumeration.

LineWidth= integer value defining the line width. Valid width values can be found in the[swLineWeights_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swLineWeights_e.html)enumeration.

LayerID= integer value indicating which layer holds this entity. The[ILayer](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ILayer.html)object can be obtained by passing this integer value to[ILayerMgr::GetLayerById](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ILayerMgr~GetLayerById.html)or[ILayerMgr::IGetLayerById](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ILayerMgr~IGetLayerById.html).

LayerOverride= integer with bit flags set to determine which properties, if any, have been overridden with respect to the Layer default properties. If the bit value is set, then the specific property or properties have been overridden. The bit indicators are: color = 0x1, style = 0x2, and width = 0x4. Therefore, if LayerOverride was returned as 3, you know the color and style have been specifically set for this item and may not match the default values associated with this item's layer.

ptLoc[3]= an array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the point location

...

This set of data repeats for each user point in the view. The size of the array is (NumPts * 8). To determine the number of points in the view, see[IView::GetUserPointsCount](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IView~GetUserPointsCount.html).

The data returned from this method is in terms of view space. If you want the data in terms of sheet space (that is, the 0,0 origin being the lower-left corner of the sheet), then combine this data with the three return values from[IView::GetXForm](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IView~GetXform.html)or[IView::IGetXForm](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IView~IGetXform.html).

The sheet must be visible. See[ISheet::SheetFormatVisible](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISheet~SheetFormatVisible.html).
