# Convert Curves into 3D Sketches Example (VBA)

This example:

- Shows how to convert curves (edges) into 3D sketches.
- Uses IModelDoc2::SketchConvertIsoCurves to extract
  ISO-parametric (UV) curves from a face or surface. Specifically, this
  code shows how to extract the curves containing a vertex.

```
'---------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open a part or fully resolved assembly.
' 2. Select a face.
' 3. Press the Ctrl key and select a vertex.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Generates two 3D sketches:
'    * First 3D sketch is edge of face in V direction
'      from the selected vertex.
'    * Second 3D sketch is edge of face in U direction
'      from the selected vertex.
' 2. Examine the graphics area and FeatureManager design
'    tree.
