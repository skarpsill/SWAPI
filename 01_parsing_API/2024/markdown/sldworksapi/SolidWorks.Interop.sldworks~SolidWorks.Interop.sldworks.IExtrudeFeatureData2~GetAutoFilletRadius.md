Function GetAutoFilletRadius() As System.Double
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IExtrudeFeatureData2
Dim value As System.Double

value = instance.GetAutoFilletRadius()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.double GetAutoFilletRadius()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.double GetAutoFilletRadius();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

Fillet radius, if feature has automatic corner fillets enabled

## VBA Syntax

See

[ExtrudeFeatureData2::GetAutoFilletRadius](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~ExtrudeFeatureData2~GetAutoFilletRadius.html)

.

## Remarks

This method only applies to thin feature extrusions. If the feature is not a thin feature extrusion, then the return value is 0.0, and the COM version of this method returns S_false in the status return value.

If the feature does not have automatic corner fillets enabled, then the return value is 0.0 and the COM version of this method returns S_false in the status return value.

To get whether automatic corner fillet is enabled, use[IExtrudeFeatureData2::GetAutoFilletCorners](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IExtrudeFeatureData2~GetAutoFilletCorners.html).kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}To set automatic fillets and radius, use[IExtrudeFeatureData2::SetAutoFillet](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IExtrudeFeatureData2~SetAutoFillet.html).
