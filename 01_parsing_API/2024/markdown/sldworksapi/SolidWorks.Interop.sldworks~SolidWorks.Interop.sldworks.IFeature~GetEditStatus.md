## Examples

[Get Editing Status of Features (VB.NET)](Get_Editing_Status_of_Features_Example_VBNET.htm)

[Get Editing Status of Features (VBA)](Get_Editing_Status_of_Features_Example_VB.htm)

[Get Editing Status of Features (C#)](Get_Editing_Status_of_Features_Example_CSharp.htm)

## Remarks

Although swFeatureEditStatus_e is a bitmask, you currently cannot combine its mutually exclusive enumerators and you must examine the bit value of the return value for the editing status of the feature.

| If... | Then the return value will be... |
| --- | --- |
| a feature and all of its dependent items are not currently being edited | 0 (swFeature_Editable) for the feature and all of its dependent items |
| a feature is currently being edited | 1 (swFeature_NonEditable); this will also be the return value for all of the feature's dependent items |
| a sketch is currently being edited | 2 (swFeature_UnderEditing) |
