Creating subsequent geometry resides in this drawing view or sheet.

If you selected a drawing view and called IDrawingDoc::EditSketch, then you can resume editing the drawing sheet by calling[IDrawingDoc::EditSheet](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IDrawingDoc~EditSheet.html)or by selecting the sheet and calling IDrawingDoc::EditSketch again.

To determine the current state, use[IDrawingDoc::GetEditSheet](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IDrawingDoc~GetEditSheet.html).
