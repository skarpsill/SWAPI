# Apply and Remove Texture To and From a Model by Display State Example (VBA)

This example shows how to add and remove texture to and from a model using
the name of a display state model.

```
'----------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions: Verify that the specified part and texture exist.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Opens the specified part and applies texture to the part.
' 2. At Stop, examine the part to verify that the texture was applied.
' 3. In the IDE, click the Continue button to resume
'    execution of macro.
' 4. Examine the part to verify that the texture was removed.
'
' NOTE: Because the part document is used elsewhere, do not save
' changes.
