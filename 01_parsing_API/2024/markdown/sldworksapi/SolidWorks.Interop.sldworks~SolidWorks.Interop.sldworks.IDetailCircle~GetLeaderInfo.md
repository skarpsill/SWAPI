# GetLeaderInfo Method (IDetailCircle)

Gets the leader information for this detail circle.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetLeaderInfo() As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IDetailCircle
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.GetLeaderInfo()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object GetLeaderInfo()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ GetLeaderInfo();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

Array (see

Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

See

[DetailCircle::GetLeaderInfo](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~DetailCircle~GetLeaderInfo.html)

.

## Remarks

There can be 0, 1 or 2 lines in the leader line. If the GTol is not attached, there are 0 lines. Otherwise, leaders can use a straight leaderline (1 line) or a bent leaderline (2 lines). Your applications must infer the number of leader lines based on[IGtol::IsAttached](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IGtol~IsAttached.html)and[IGtol::HasExtraLeader](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IGtol~HasExtraLeader.html).

- IsAttached() == false implies no leaderline, therefore, no leaderline points (PointCount=0).
- HasExtraLeader() == false means that this is a straight leaderline, therefore, 1 line (PointCount=2)
- HasExtraLeader() == True means that this is a bent leaderline, therefore, 2 lines (PointCount=3)

Format of return information is the following array of doubles:

- retval[0] = X-coordinate of first leader point
- retval[1] = Y-coordinate of first leader point
- retval[2] = Z-coordinate of first leader point
- retval[3] = X-coordinate of second leader point
- retval[4] = Y-coordinate of second leader point
- retval[5] = Z-coordinate of second leader point
- retval[6] = X-coordinate of third leader point
- retval[7] = Y-coordinate of third leader point
- retval[8] = Z-coordinate of third leader point
