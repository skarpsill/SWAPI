   ByVal Component As System.Object _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IStructureSystemMemberFeatureData
Dim TopDoc As System.Object
Dim Component As System.Object
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.AccessSelections(TopDoc, Component)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool AccessSelections(
   System.object TopDoc,
   System.object Component
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool AccessSelections(
   System.Object^ TopDoc,
   System.Object^ Component
)
```

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `TopDoc`: Top level document (see

Remarks

)
- `Component`: Component for the feature (see

Remarks

)

### Return Value

True if selections successfully accessed, false if not

## Remarks

| To modify a feature in a... | Then... |
| --- | --- |
| Part | TopDoc argument is the IModelDoc2 for the part Component argument is NULL |
| Assembly | TopDoc is the IModelDoc2 object for the assembly Component argument is the IComponent2 object in which the feature is to be modified |

This method puts the model into a rollback state to allow access to the selections that define this feature. You must use either of the following methods to restore the rollback state:

- [IFeature::ModifyDefinition](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html)

  if you modified the feature
- [IStructureSystemMemberFeatureData::ReleaseSelectionAccess](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IStructureSystemMemberFeatureData~ReleaseSelectionAccess.html)

  if you did not modify the feature
