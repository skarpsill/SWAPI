# Create Secondary Structure System Members Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to create two secondary structure system members: one
between primary member pair end points and the other on a support plane between
a primary member pair.

```vb
  '==========================================================================================
 'Preconditions:
 '1. Ensure the specified part template exists.
 '2. Open an Immediate window.
 '3. Press F5.
 '
 'Postconditions:
 ' 1. Creates Sketch1 containing two sketch segments.
 ' 2. Configures the start/end extensions and the member profile.
 ' 3. Selects the two sketch segments.
 ' 4. Creates primary Structure System1 with two primary path segment members (Member1 and Member2).
 ' 5. Inspect the structure system in the graphics area.
 ' 6. Press F5 to add a secondary support plane member.
 '     Creates secondary Structure System2 (Member3).
 ' 7. Press F5 to edit the support plane member.
 ' 8. Press F5 to add a secondary between points member.
 '     Creates secondary Structure System3 (Member4).
 ' 9. Press F5 to edit the between points member.
```

'10. Press F5 to add a secondary structure system up to
member.

'11. When the macro stops, multi-select a Member1 vertex

' in the graphics area and Member2 in the FeatureManager
Design tree.

'12. Press F5 to create the secondary Structure
System4 ( Member5 ).

'13. Inspect the Immediate window.
