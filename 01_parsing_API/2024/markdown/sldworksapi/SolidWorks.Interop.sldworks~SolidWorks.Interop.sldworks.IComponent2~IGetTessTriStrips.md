# IGetTessTriStrips Method (IComponent2)

Gets the vertices that make up the shaded picture tessellation for this component.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetTessTriStrips( _
   ByVal NoConversion As System.Boolean _
) As System.Single
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IComponent2
Dim NoConversion As System.Boolean
Dim value As System.Single

value = instance.IGetTessTriStrips(NoConversion)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.float IGetTessTriStrips(
   System.bool NoConversion
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.float IGetTessTriStrips(
   System.bool NoConversion
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `NoConversion`: True prohibits conversion to user units from system units, false does not

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of floats (see

  Remarks

  )

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

## Remarks

Tessellation information is available only when the component is loaded as lightweight.

These triangles are intended for graphical display purposes and do not represent a tessellation that could be used, for example, by a machining application. If you need the type of accuracy associated with a machining product, you should traverse the body faces and extract the topology and geometry data to create your own faceting.

where:

- FaceCount

  = number of faces on the body
- StripCount

  = total number of strips on the body
- VertexCount

  x 3 = total number of vertices. Multiplied by three to cover X,Y, and Z
- NumStrips

  = number of strips on a particular face
- VertexPerStrip

  = an array containing the number of vertex points on particular face strip
- VertexPoints

  = an array of X,Y,Z points for each vertex on the particular face strip

Because the returned array elements are of type float, and`FaceCount`,`StripCount`,`VertexCount`,`NumStrips`, and the elements of`VertexPerStrip`are integers that have been packed into the return array elements, and you must[unpack](sldworksAPIProgGuide.chm::/OVERVIEW/Unpacking_Double_Arrays_into_Integer_Pairs_in_Visual_Basic_.NET_and_Visual_Basic.htm)them before you can use them.

For example:

- sa[0] = number of faces
- sa[1] = total number of strips
- sa[2] = total number of vertices x 3 (i.e., - data values)

For each face:

- sa[3] = number of strips in this face
- sa[4] = number of vertices in first strip of this face
- sa[5] = number of vertices in second strip of this face

...

- sa[3 + sa[3&cd; = number of vertices in last strip of this face

For each strip, i:

- sa[3 + sa[3] + 1] = X value of first vertex in this strip of the face
- sa[3 + sa[3] + 2] = Y value of first vertex in this strip of the face
- sa[3 + sa[3] + 3] = Z value of first vertex in this strip of the face
- sa[3 + sa[3] + 4] = X value of second vertex in this strip of the face

...

- sa[3 + sa[3] + (sa[3+i] x 3)] = Z value of last vertex in this strip of the face
