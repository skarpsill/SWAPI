# IGetTessNorms Method (IComponent2)

Gets the normal vector for each of the triangles, which make up the shaded picture tessellation for the component.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetTessNorms() As System.Single
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IComponent2
Dim value As System.Single

value = instance.IGetTessNorms()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.float IGetTessNorms()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.float IGetTessNorms();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of floats (see

  Remarks

  )

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

## Remarks

Tessellation information is available only when the component is loaded as lightweight.

The format of retval is:

- float x, y, z - first point's unit normal
- float x, y, z - second point's unit normal
- float x, y, z - third point's unit normal

for the set of triangles for the component.

The total size of the data is[9 x sizeof(float) x (number of triangles)].
