# Create Simulation Gravity Feature Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to create a simulation gravity feature in a motion
study.

```vb
  '---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
 ' 1. Verify that the specified model document exists.
 ' 2. In SOLIDWORKS, verify that View > MotionManager is selected.
  ' 3. In the IDE, right-click the project name in the Project Explorer,
 '    click Add Reference, browse to install_dir\api\redist, and select
 '    SolidWorks.Interop.swmotionstudy.dll.
 ' 4. Click OK.
 ' 5. Open an Immediate window.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1. Adds Gravity to the MotionManager design tree on the Motion Study 1 tab.
 ' 2. Inspect the Immediate window.
 '
 ' NOTE: Because the model is used elsewhere,
 ' do not save changes when closing it.
