# CreateByExplode Method (IMotionStudy)

Creates an animation in which a collapsed view of an assembly is exploded.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function CreateByExplode( _
   ByVal DeleteExistingPath As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal Duration As System.Double, _
   ByVal StartTime As System.Double _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IMotionStudy
Dim DeleteExistingPath As System.Boolean
Dim Duration As System.Double
Dim StartTime As System.Double
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.CreateByExplode(DeleteExistingPath, Duration, StartTime)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool CreateByExplode(
   System.bool DeleteExistingPath,
   System.double Duration,
   System.double StartTime
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool CreateByExplode(
   System.bool DeleteExistingPath,
   System.double Duration,
   System.double StartTime
)
```

### Parameters

- `DeleteExistingPath`: True to delete any existing animation sequences, false to not
- `Duration`: Length of time of the animation in seconds
- `StartTime`: Time to start this animation (see

Remarks

)

### Return Value

True if the animation is created, false if not

## VBA Syntax

See

[MotionStudy::CreateByExplode](ms-its:swmotionstudyapivb6.chm::/SwMotionStudy~MotionStudy~CreateByExplode.html)

.

## Examples

[Duplicate, Delete, and Create Motion Study (C#)](Duplicate,_Delete,_and_Create_Motion_Study_Example_CSharp.htm)

[Duplicate, Delete, and Create Motion Study (VB.NET)](Duplicate,_Delete,_and_Create_Motion_Study_Example_VBNET.htm)

[Duplicate, Delete, and Create Motion Study (VBA)](Duplicate,_Delete,_and_Create_Motion_Study_Example_VB.htm)

## Remarks

If you have existing animation sequences, then the start time of this animation should account for the total time of all previous sequences. If this is a new animation sequence, set StartTime to 0 to start the animation immediately, or type a value to delay the start of the sequence.

Example:

' Precondition: Active document contains an exploded view of an assembly .

Option Explicit

kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}

Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks

Dim swModel As SldWorks.ModelDoc2

Dim swModelDocExt As SldWorks.ModelDocExtension

Dim swMotionMgr As SwMotionStudy.MotionStudyManager

Dim swMotion As SwMotionStudy.MotionStudy

Dim boolstatus As Boolean

kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}

Sub main()

kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}

Set swApp = Application.SldWorks

'Active document contains an exploded view of an assembly

Set swModel = swApp. ActiveDoc

Set swModelDocExt = swModel. Extension

Set swMotionMgr = swModelDocExt. GetMotionStudyManager

' Create a new motion study

Set swMotion = swMotionMgr. CreateMotionStudy

' Delete any existing animation sequences,

' set the animation duration to 5 seconds, and play

' the animation immediately when IMotionStudy::Play is called

boolstatus = swMotion. CreateByExplode (True, 5, 0)

' Play the animation

swMotion. Play

kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}

End Sub
