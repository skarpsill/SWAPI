## Remarks

Typical steps for creating a motion study's plot data and plot:

1. Open an assembly model and create the motion study.
2. Select the model's entities whose motion you want to measure.
3. Perform the calculations and get the results.
4. Create a plot feature data.
5. Create the plot's x-axis and y-axis feature data objects.
6. Set the type of plot.
7. Select the result component.
8. Set the entities for the x-axis and y-axis feature data objects.
9. Get the plot's x-axis and y-axis values and insert and display the plot.

Examine the examples to see the calls for these steps.
