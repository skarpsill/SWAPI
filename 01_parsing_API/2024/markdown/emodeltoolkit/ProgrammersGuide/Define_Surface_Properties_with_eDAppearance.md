# Define Surface Properties with eDAppearance

When creating a[eDPart](../eDPart/eDPart_Class.htm),[eDAssembly](../eDAssembly/eDAssembly_Class.htm),[eDBody](../eDBody/eDBody_Class.htm),[eDCurvleList](../eDCurveList/eDCurveList_Class.htm),[eDShellList](../eDShellList/eDShellList_Class.htm),
or[eDMarkerList](../eDMarkerList/eDMarkerList_Class.htm),
you apply the[eDAppearance](../eDAppearance/eDAppearance_Class.htm)object to it.

The lowest level object's appearance overrides all higher level objects'
appearances. For example, a body specified as red that contains a face
specified as blue and an edge with no specification will render a blue
face and a red edge.
