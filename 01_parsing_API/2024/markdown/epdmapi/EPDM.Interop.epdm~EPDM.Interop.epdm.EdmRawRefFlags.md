## Members

| Member | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Edmrrf_Ghost | 1 = DWG files can store grandchildren as references; for example, in the file tree: A.dwg=>B.dwg=>C.dwg the file C.dwg can be stored as a ghost reference in A.dwg and as a normal reference in B.dwg; SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional does not show ghost references in check-in dialog boxes but does update them when files are moved |
| Edmrrf_InternalComponent | 2 = Not used |
| Edmrrf_Nothing | 0 = Normal file reference |
