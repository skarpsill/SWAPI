# IncludeThermostat Property (ICWHeatPower)

Obsolete. Superseded by[ICWHeatPower::IncludeThermostat2](SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks~SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks.ICWHeatPower~IncludeThermostat2.html).

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property IncludeThermostat As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICWHeatPower
Dim value As System.Integer

instance.IncludeThermostat = value

value = instance.IncludeThermostat
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int IncludeThermostat {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.int IncludeThermostat {
   System.int get();
   void set (    System.int value);
}
```

### Property Value

1 to include thermostat, 0 to not

## VBA Syntax

See

[CWHeatPower::IncludeThermostat](ms-its:cworksapivb6.chm::/CosmosWorksLib~CWHeatPower~IncludeThermostat.html)

.

## Remarks

Thermostat is used for transient[thermal](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks.ICWThermalStudyOptions.html)studies only.
