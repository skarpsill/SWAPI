# DeleteFatigueEvent Method (ICWFatigueStudyOptions)

Deletes the specified fatigue event.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub DeleteFatigueEvent( _
   ByVal SName As System.String _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICWFatigueStudyOptions
Dim SName As System.String

instance.DeleteFatigueEvent(SName)
```

### C#

```csharp
void DeleteFatigueEvent(
   System.string SName
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void DeleteFatigueEvent(
   System.String^ SName
)
```

### Parameters

- `SName`: Name of the fatigue event to delete (see

Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

See

[CWFatigueStudyOptions::DeleteFatigueEvent](ms-its:cworksapivb6.chm::/CosmosWorksLib~CWFatigueStudyOptions~DeleteFatigueEvent.html)

.

## Remarks

To delete a fatigue event by name, you need to first find the name by iterating through all of the fatigue events:

1. Call

  [ICWFatigueStudyOptions::LoadingEventCount](SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks~SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks.ICWFatigueStudyOptions~LoadingEventCount.html)

  to get the number of fatigue events,

  n

  .
2. In a loop where i = 0 to

  n

  - 1, call

  [ICWFatigueStudyOptions::GetFatigueEvent](SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks~SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks.ICWFatigueStudyOptions~GetFatigueEvent.html)

  (

  i, ErrorCode

  ) to get each

  [ICWFatigueEvent](SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks~SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks.ICWFatigueEvent.html)

  .
3. Populate SName with

  [ICWFatigueEvent::Name](SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks~SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks.ICWFatigueEvent~Name.html)

  of the fatigue event you want to delete.
