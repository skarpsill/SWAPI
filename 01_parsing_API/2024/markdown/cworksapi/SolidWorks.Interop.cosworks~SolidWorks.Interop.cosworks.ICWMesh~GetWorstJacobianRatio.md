# GetWorstJacobianRatio Method (ICWMesh)

Gets the worst Jacobian ratio for this mesh.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetWorstJacobianRatio() As System.Double
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICWMesh
Dim value As System.Double

value = instance.GetWorstJacobianRatio()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.double GetWorstJacobianRatio()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.double GetWorstJacobianRatio();
```

### Return Value

Worst Jacobian ratio (see

Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

## Remarks

The data returned by this method is valid only if[ICWMesh::Quality](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks.ICWMesh~Quality.html)is set to[swsMeshQuality_e](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks.swsMeshQuality_e.html).swsMeshQualityHigh.

Analysis of curved geometry requires a mesh of parabolic tetrahedral elements. With extremely curved edges, placement of the mid-side nodes of these elements on the geometry can distort the elements and the analysis.

The Jacobian ratio calculated at a point inside a parabolic mesh element provides a measure of the degree of distortion at that location. The higher the ratio, the greater the distortion of the element. A Jacobian ratio of 40 or less is acceptable. A negative Jacobian ratio causes SOLIDWORKS analysis to stop.

Call this method after[ICWStudy::CreateMesh](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks.ICWStudy~CreateMesh.html)to calculate the worst or highest Jacobian ratio among the elements of this mesh.

See the SOLIDWORKS Simulation Help for more information about Jacobian ratios and meshes.
