# Analyze Part Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to perform a static analysis of a part and plot nodal
strain results.

NOTE:To get persistent reference
identifiers (PIDs) for model selections, you can use[pidcollector.exe](GettingStarted-swsimulationapi.html)or IModelDocExtension::GetPersistReference3.

```vb
'----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
 '  1. Add the SOLIDWORKS Simulation as an add-in (in SOLIDWORKS, click
 '     Tools > Add-ins > SOLIDWORKS Simulation > OK).
 '  2. Add the SOLIDWORKS Simulation primary interop assembly as a reference
 '     (in the IDE, click Project > Add Reference > .NET >
 '     SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks > OK).
 '  3. Modify the path to solidworks materials.sldmat as needed.
 '  4. Ensure that the specified part exists.
 '  5. Open the Immediate window.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 '  1. Adds a default static study results plot.
 '  2. Creates study, Static_solid.
 '  3. Applies material to the model.
 '  4. Applies restraints and pressure to the selected faces.
 '  5. Creates a mesh.
 '  6. Runs the analysis.
 '  7. Prints strain and stress results to the Immediate window.
 '  8. Creates a nodal equivalent strain plot of the results.
 '  9. Prints plot data to the Immediate window.
 ' 10. Hides fixture and force symbols. Examine the graphics area
 '     to verify.
 ' 11. Press F5 to continue.
 ' 12. Shows fixture and force symbols. Examine the graphics area
 '     to verify.
 ' 13. Inspect the plots.
 '
 ' NOTE: Because the model is used elsewhere, do not save any changes.
