# LowerBoundFrequency Property (ICWFrequencyStudyOptions)

Gets or sets the frequency to which frequencies closest are calculated in this
frequency study.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property LowerBoundFrequency As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICWFrequencyStudyOptions
Dim value As System.Integer

instance.LowerBoundFrequency = value

value = instance.LowerBoundFrequency
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int LowerBoundFrequency {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.int LowerBoundFrequency {
   System.int get();
   void set (    System.int value);
}
```

### Property Value

Frequency value to which frequencies closest are calculated

## VBA Syntax

See

[CWFrequencyStudyOptions::LowerBoundFrequency](ms-its:cworksapivb6.chm::/CosmosWorksLib~CWFrequencyStudyOptions~LowerBoundFrequency.html)

.

## Examples
