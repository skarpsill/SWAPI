# ConvectionCoefficient Property (ICWConvection)

Gets or sets the convection coefficient used in defining convection for thermal
studies.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property ConvectionCoefficient As System.Double
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICWConvection
Dim value As System.Double

instance.ConvectionCoefficient = value

value = instance.ConvectionCoefficient
```

### C#

```csharp
System.double ConvectionCoefficient {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.double ConvectionCoefficient {
   System.double get();
   void set (    System.double value);
}
```

### Property Value

Convection coefficient
