# JacobianPoints Property (ICWMesh)

Gets or sets the number of points to be used in calculating a Jacobian ratio.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property JacobianPoints As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICWMesh
Dim value As System.Integer

instance.JacobianPoints = value

value = instance.JacobianPoints
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int JacobianPoints {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.int JacobianPoints {
   System.int get();
   void set (    System.int value);
}
```

### Property Value

Number of Jacobian points (see

Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

See

[CWMesh::JacobianPoints](ms-its:cworksapivb6.chm::/CosmosWorksLib~CWMesh~JacobianPoints.html)

.

## Remarks

This property:

- is valid only if

  [ICWMesh::Quality](SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks~SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks.ICWMesh~Quality.html)

  is set to

  [swsMeshQuality_e](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks.swsMeshQuality_e.html)

  .swsMeshQualityHigh.
- has 4 possible values:

  - 4 = Number of points inside the element tetrahedron near its vertices
  - 16 = Number of points inside the element tetrahedron
  - 29 = Number of points inside the element tetrahedron (same as 16 but calculates a more precise Jacobian ratio)
  - 10 = At nodes; Number of points = 4 vertices + 6 midpoints on 6 edges of the element tetrahedron
