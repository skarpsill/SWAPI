# Get Frequencies in Mode Shape Plots Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to get frequencies for all mode shapes in amplitude
plots.

```vb
  '----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
 ' 1. Add the SOLIDWORKS Simulation as an add-in (in SOLIDWORKS, click
 '    Tools > Add-ins > SOLIDWORKS Simulation > OK).
 ' 2. Add the SOLIDWORKS Simulation primary interop assembly as a reference
 '    (in the IDE, click Project > Add Reference > .NET >
 '    SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks > OK).
 ' 3. Ensure that the specified model exists.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1. Meshes the model.
 ' 2. Analyzes the study.
  ' 3. Gets the frequencies of all amplitude plot mode shapes.
  ' 4. Displays a message box with the frequency for mode shape 2.
 ' 5. Click OK.
 '
  ' NOTE: Because the model is used elsewhere, do not save changes.
