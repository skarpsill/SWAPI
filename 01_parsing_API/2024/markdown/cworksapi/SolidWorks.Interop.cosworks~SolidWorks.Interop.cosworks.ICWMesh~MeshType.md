# MeshType Property (ICWMesh)

Returns the mesh type.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
ReadOnly Property MeshType As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICWMesh
Dim value As System.Integer

value = instance.MeshType
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int MeshType {get;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.int MeshType {
   System.int get();
}
```

### Property Value

Mesh type as defined in[swsMeshType_e](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks.swsMeshType_e.html)(see**Remarks**)

## VBA Syntax

See

[CWMesh::MeshType](ms-its:cworksapivb6.chm::/CosmosWorksLib~CWMesh~MeshType.html)

.

## Remarks

Valid mesh types for different types of studies:

(Table)=========================================================

| Study Type | Solid Mesh | Shell Mesh | Mixed Mesh (Solid & Shell) | Beam Mesh |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Static | Supported | Supported | Supported | Supported |
| Frequency | Supported | Supported | Supported | Supported |
| Buckling | Supported | Supported | Supported | Supported |
| Thermal | Supported | Supported | Supported | Supported |
| Nonlinear | Supported | Supported | Supported | Not Supported |
| Linear Dynamic | Supported | Supported | Supported | Not Supported |
| Drop Test | Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported |
| Fatigue | Not Applicable | Not Applicable | Not Applicable | Not Applicable |
| Optimization | Not Applicable | Not Applicable | Not Applicable | Not Applicable |

**NOTES:**

- For documents with surface geometry only (no solids), only RefSurfShellElementMesh is supported.
- BeamElementMesh is supported only for static, buckling, and frequency studies.
- Drop test studies support solid mesh only.
- Optimization and fatigue studies do not have mesh on their own. They use mesh of referenced studies. Mesh type is set to SolidElementMesh.
