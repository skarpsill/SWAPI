# IncludeThermostat2 Property (ICWHeatFlux)

Gets or sets whether to include thermostat effects in this heat flux.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property IncludeThermostat2 As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICWHeatFlux
Dim value As System.Boolean

instance.IncludeThermostat2 = value

value = instance.IncludeThermostat2
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool IncludeThermostat2 {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.bool IncludeThermostat2 {
   System.bool get();
   void set (    System.bool value);
}
```

### Property Value

-1 or true to include thermostat effects, 0 or false to not

## Examples

See the

[ICWHeatFlux](SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks~SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks.ICWHeatFlux.html)

examples.

## Remarks

Thermostat is used for transient thermal studies only.

This property returns a boolean value which can be cast to an integer. To set this property, you can specify either the boolean or the integer.
