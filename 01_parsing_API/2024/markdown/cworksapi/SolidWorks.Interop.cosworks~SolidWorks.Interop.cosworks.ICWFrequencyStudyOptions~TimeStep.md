# TimeStep Property (ICWFrequencyStudyOptions)

Gets or sets the time step for which to import a single temperature from a transient thermal study.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property TimeStep As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICWFrequencyStudyOptions
Dim value As System.Integer

instance.TimeStep = value

value = instance.TimeStep
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int TimeStep {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.int TimeStep {
   System.int get();
   void set (    System.int value);
}
```

### Property Value

Time step for which to import a single temperature from a transient thermal study

## VBA Syntax

See

[CWFrequencyStudyOptions::TimeStep](ms-its:cworksapivb6.chm::/CosmosWorksLib~CWFrequencyStudyOptions~TimeStep.html)

.

## Examples

See the

[ICWFrequencyStudyOptions](SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks~SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks.ICWFrequencyStudyOptions.html)

examples.

## Remarks

This property is valid only if:

- [ICWFrequencyStudyOptions::ThermalResults](SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks~SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks.ICWFrequencyStudyOptions~ThermalResults.html)

  is set to

  [swsThermalOption_e](SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks~SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks.swsThermalOption_e.html)

  .swsThermalOption_TemperatureFromThermalStudy.
- [ICWFrequencyStudyOptions::ThermalStudyName](SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks~SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks.ICWFrequencyStudyOptions~ThermalStudyName.html)

  is specified and is a transient thermal study.
