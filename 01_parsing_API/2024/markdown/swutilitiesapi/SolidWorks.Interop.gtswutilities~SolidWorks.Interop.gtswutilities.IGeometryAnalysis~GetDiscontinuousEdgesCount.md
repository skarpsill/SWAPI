# GetDiscontinuousEdgesCount Method (IGeometryAnalysis)

Gets the number of discontinuous edges in the part.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetDiscontinuousEdgesCount( _
   ByRef errorcode As System.Integer _
) As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IGeometryAnalysis
Dim errorcode As System.Integer
Dim value As System.Integer

value = instance.GetDiscontinuousEdgesCount(errorcode)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int GetDiscontinuousEdgesCount(
   out System.int errorcode
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.int GetDiscontinuousEdgesCount(
   [Out] System.int errorcode
)
```

### Parameters

- `errorcode`: Error as defined by

[gtError_e](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.gtswutilities~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.gtswutilities.gtError_e.html)

### Return Value

Number of discontinuous edges

## VBA Syntax

See

[IGeometryAnalysis::GetDiscontinuousEdgesCount](ms-its:swutilitiesapivb6.chm::/swutilities~IGeometryAnalysis~GetDiscontinuousEdgesCount.html)

.

## Examples

[Analyze Geometry (VBA)](Analyze_Geometry_VB6.htm)

## Remarks

All edges in the part where the underlying curve geometry has position or tangent discontinuity are discontinuous edges.
