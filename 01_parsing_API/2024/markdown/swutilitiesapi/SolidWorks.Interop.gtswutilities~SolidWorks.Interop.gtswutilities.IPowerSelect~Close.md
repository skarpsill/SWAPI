## Remarks

Because you cannot have more than one SOLIDWORKS Utilities tool running at any one time, you must close a running PowerSelect session before you can use another SOLIDWORKS Utilities tool. To initialize a PowerSelect session, call

[IPowerSelect::Init](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.gtswutilities~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.gtswutilities.IPowerSelect~Init.html)

.
