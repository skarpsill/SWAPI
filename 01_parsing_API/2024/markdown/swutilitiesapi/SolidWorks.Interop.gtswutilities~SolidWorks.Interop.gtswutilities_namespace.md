# SolidWorks.Interop.gtswutilities Namespace

SOLIDWORKS Utilities API

## Interfaces

| Interface | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ICompareDocument | Compares the properties of two SOLIDWORKS documents. |
| ICompareFeature | Identifies the differences in solid features between two versions of the same part. |
| ICompareGeometry | Identifies the differences in geometry in both solid features and surface models between two versions of the same part. |
| IFeaturePaint | Allows you to copy the feature parameters from one feature in a SOLIDWORKS part to a feature in a different SOLIDWORKS part. |
| IFindReplaceAnnotations | Finds and replaces text for the annotations in the currently open part, assembly, or drawing document. |
| IGeometryAnalysis | Identifies geometric entities in a part that could cause a problem in other applications. |
| IPowerSelect | Allows selection of entities (edges, loops, faces, or features) in a part that meet the specified criteria. |
| IThicknessAnalysis | Allows you to determine and analyze the thickness of a part. |
| IUtilities | Gets the SOLIDWORKS Utilities tool interface and options. |
| IUtilOptions | Gets or sets the angular and position tolerance options when comparing faces. |
