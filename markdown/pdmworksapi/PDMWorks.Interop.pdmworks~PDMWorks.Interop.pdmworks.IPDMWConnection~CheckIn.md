object

## VBA Syntax

See

[PDMWConnection::CheckIn](ms-its:pdmworksapivb6.chm::/pdmworks~PDMWConnection~CheckIn.html)

.

## Remarks

The document to check in must be closed before calling this method.

**IMPORTANT**: Because this method is dependent on**pdmworks_libFNP.dll**, you must ensure that your application can find this DLL. The simplest way for your application to find**pdmworks_libFNP.dll**is to add its location to the PATH environmental variable. See[Microsoft Corp's Dynamic-Link Library Search Order](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682586(v=vs.85).aspx)for details.

This method only works on computers where both the SOLIDWORKS Workgroup PDM Contributor or Addin client software and SOLIDWORKS Workgroup PDMkadov_tag{{</spaces>}}API DLL are installed.

This method can check in multiple file types, e.g., SOLIDWORKS, eDrawings, Microsoft Word, text, bitmap, PDF, etc.; however, only SOLIDWORKS documents saved in SOLIDWORKS 99 and later are supported by this method.

You must own the document before you can check it in. See[IPDMWDocument::TakeOwnership](PDMWorks.Interop.pdmworks~PDMWorks.Interop.pdmworks.IPDMWDocument~TakeOwnership.html)for details about how to take ownership of a document.

If i_revOption is set to PDMWRevisionOptionType.Other, then the revision argument is used.

(Table)=========================================================

| If checking in a document that references... | Then... |
| --- | --- |
| Non-Microsoft Word or Excel documents | The references argument is ignored. Instead, you must use IPDMWConnection::CheckIn to check in each referenced document individually. |
| Microsoft Word or Excel documents | The array of references is used. |
