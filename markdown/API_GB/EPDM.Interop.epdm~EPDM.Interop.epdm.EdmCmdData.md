# EdmCmdData Structure

Contains command data.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic

```vb
Public Structure EdmCmdData
   Inherits System.ValueType
```

### C#

```csharp
public struct EdmCmdData : System.ValueType
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
public value class EdmCmdData : public System.ValueType
```

## Examples

struct EdmCmdData{ integer mlObjectID1 ; integer mlObjectID2 ; integer mlObjectID3 ; integer mlObjectID4 ; string mbsStrData1 ; string mbsStrData2 ; string mbsStrData3 ; integer mlLongData1 ; integer mlLongData2 ; integer mlLongData3 ; object* mpoExtra ; };

## Remarks

SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional passes an array of 0 or more EdmCmdData structures when it calls to[IEdmAddIn5::OnCmd](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmAddIn5~OnCmd.html).

Typically there is one structure for each file affected by the command. For instance, if the user has selected five files and two folders and launches an add-in-implemented menu command, the add-in receives seven structures, one for each of the selected files and folders. If the reason for calling IEdmAddIn5::OnCmd is a hook on a command like Check out, Check in, Get, Change state, etc., the add-in receives one structure per file. The actual meaning of each structure member varies with the reason for calling IEdmAddIn5::OnCmd. The reason for a call can be determined by examining the meCmdType member of the[EdmCmd structure](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmd.html)that is passed in the first argument of IEdmAddIn5::OnCmd.

The following tables contain all members for each[EdmCmdType](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmdType.html). Members that are not listed for a certain type of command do not use EdmCmdData.

##### EdmCmdType .EdmCmd_ActivateAPITab

When a custom vault view tab is selected in a vault view in File Explorer, sends only to the add-in that adds the custom vault view tab to File Explorer.

| EdmCmdData Members | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mbsStrData3 | string | Unique ID of this control |

##### EdmCmdType .EdmCmd_PreExploreInit

When a new instance of File Explorer to about to be created, this event is sent to allow you to create custom tabs in the vault view in File Explorer. This event does not provide any EdmCmdData information. But you will receive a pointer to the IEdmCmdMgr6 interface in the[EdmCmd::mpoExtra](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmd~mpoExtra.html)member. In the event handler, call[IEdmCmdMgr6::AddValtViewTab](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmCmdMgr6~AddVaultViewTab.html)for each tab you want to add to the vault view in File Explorer.

##### EdmCmdType .EdmCmd_TaskSetup

This call is made to your add-in when the[task](Tasks.htm)definition property dialog box is called. The call makes it possible for you to add your own custom pages to the wizard. The[EdmCmd::mpoExtra](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmd~mpoExtra.html)pointer points to[IEdmTaskProperties](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmTaskProperties.html), the interface of the task definition.

You typically do the following in this call:

- Call

  [IEdmTaskProperties::SetSetupPages](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmTaskProperties~SetSetupPages.html)

  to add property dialog box pages.
- Call

  [IEdmTaskProperties::SetMenuCmds](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmTaskProperties~SetMenuCmds.html)

  to add menu commands to show in File Explorer.
- Update the

  [IEdmTaskProperties::TaskFlags](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmTaskProperties~TaskFlags.html)

  property to inform the framework about what your add-in is capable of.

None of the members in the EdmCmdData structure are used.

##### EdmCmdType .EdmCmd_TaskSetupButton

This call is made to your add-in when the[task](Tasks.htm)definition property dialog box is closed. The[EdmCmd::mbsComment](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmd~mbsComment.html)string is either "OK" or "Cancel", depending on how the dialog box closed. (The string is the same in all localized versions of the program.) The call makes it possible for you to save your own properties when**OK**is clicked. You can prevent the dialog box from closing by setting the[EdmCmd::mbCancel](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmd~mbCancel.html)member to true. You can return the name of an add-in page to set focus to in the[EdmCmd::mbsComment](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmd~mbsComment.html)string if[EdmCmd::mbCancel](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmd~mbCancel.html)is set to true.[EdmCmd::mpoExtra](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmd~mpoExtra.html)points to[IEdmTaskProperties](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmTaskProperties.html), the interface of the task definition.

None of the members in the EdmCmdData structure are used.

##### EdmCmdType .EdmCmd_TaskDetails

This call is made to your add-in when the[task](Tasks.htm)details dialog box is displayed from the task list in the administration tool. You must specify the flag[EdmTaskFlag](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmTaskFlag.html).EdmTask_SupportsDetails in the[IEdmTaskProperties::TaskFlags](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmTaskProperties~TaskFlags.html)property in order to get the EdmCmd_TaskDetails call. You can set the flag when you get the[EdmCmdType](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmdType.html).EdmCmd_TaskSetup call.[EdmCmd::mpoExtra](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmd~mpoExtra.html)points to[IEdmTaskInstance](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmTaskInstance.html), the interface of the task instance.

The EdmCmd::mpoExtra pointer should be set to your implementation of the extra page. The framework keeps this pointer referenced until the dialog box is closed. You return the window handle of the extra page in the member[EdmCmd::mlParentWnd](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmd~mlParentWnd.html). The property dialog box calls ShowWindow when the page is displayed or hidden.

None of the members in the EdmCmdData structure are used.

##### EdmCmdType .EdmCmd_TaskRun

This is the callback that is called when the actual work of the[task](Tasks.htm)is supposed to be executed. The task is usually executed on a remote server so you must not display any user interface during this call. See the OnTaskRun function in the[task sample code](TaskSample.htm)for an example of how to return status information and errors to the user.

The[EdmCmd::mlCurrentFolderID](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmd~mlCurrentFolderID.html)argument is the ID of the current folder when the task was launched. It is zero if the task was launched from the administration tool.

[EdmCmd::mpoExtra](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmd~mpoExtra.html)points to the[IEdmTaskInstance](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmTaskInstance.html)interface of the task instance.

| EdmCmdData Members | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mlObjectID1 | integer | ID of the selected object ( IEdmObject5::ID ) |
| mlObjectID2 | integer | Parent folder ID if the selected object is a file |
| mbsStrData1 | string | Complete file system path to the object |
| mbsStrData2 | string | Configuration name if the object is a file |
| mlLongData1 | integer | EdmObjectType constant telling what kind of object this is |

##### EdmCmdType .EdmCmd_TaskLaunch

You need to specify the EdmTask_SupportsInitExec in the[IEdmTaskProperties::TaskFlags](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmTaskProperties~TaskFlags.html)property in order to get this call. The launch call makes it possible for you to display a user interface where the user selects files or enters data in a custom dialog box. As an alternative, you can create a card with the card editor and use that instead.[EdmCmd::mpoExtra](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmd~mpoExtra.html)points to[IEdmTaskInstance](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmTaskInstance.html), the interface of the task instance in this call.

You can return a dialog box implementation (user control) in the EdmCmd::mpoExtra argument. In this case you must also return the window of the control in[EdmCmd::mlParentWnd](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmd~mlParentWnd.html). The form is then put in the same parent dialog box as the card, if you are using one.

You can set[EdmCmd::mbCancel](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmd~mbCancel.html)to true to halt further execution of the task.

The call can update the selection of objects to execute the task on by altering the content of the EdmCmdData structure.

| EdmCmdData Members | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mlObjectID1 | integer | ID of the selected object ( IEdmObject5::ID ) |
| mlObjectID2 | integer | Parent folder ID if the selected object is a file |
| mbsStrData1 | string | Complete file system path to the object |
| mbsStrData2 | string | Configuration name if the object is a file |
| mlLongData1 | integer | EdmObjectType constant telling what kind of object this is |

##### EdmCmdType .EdmCmd_TaskLaunchButton

This callback is made if the framework displays its own dialog box during the launching of a task. The framework displays its own dialog box if a card has been selected for the task or if you returned a user control from the[EdmCmdType](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmdType.html).EdmCmd_TaskLaunch hook.[EdmCmd::mbsComment](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmd~mbsComment.html)contains the string "OK" or "Cancel", depending on which button was clicked. The strings are the same on all localized versions of the program.[EdmCmd::mpoExtra](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmd~mpoExtra.html)points to IEdmTaskInstance, the interface of the task. You can set[EdmCmd::mbCancel](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmd~mbCancel.html)to true to halt further execution of the task.

None of the members in the EdmCmdData structure are used.
