# Debugging Add-ins

Add-ins are stored in the file vault and are downloaded to
and COM-registered on the client computer when they are needed. This
presents a problem when developing a new add-in that you want to debug, because the add-in is re-registered in a folder
that is different than the
compiler’s output folder. Testing an add-in in a
production vault can also be a problem, because it affects all users of the
vault.

SOLIDWORKSPDM Professional provides a menu command that solves these two problems, Debug Add-ins .

When an add-in is installed as a
debug add-in, it
is registered only on your machine. No other users are affected by it. The add-in
is also loaded from the location where it is registered.

To
debug an add-in using File Explorer:

1. Open
  the Windows Task Manager.
2. Kill the explorer.exe process.
3. Right-click the project name in the
  Solution Explorer of Visual Studio and click Properties .
4. Click the Debug tab.
5. Click Start external program and type
  the File Explorer executable's path. For example:C:\windows\explorer.exe
6. Click**Debug >**Start
  Debugging .
