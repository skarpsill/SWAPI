# Creating Add-in Hooks (C#)

This topic shows how to program
an add-in to have SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional notify your add-in
whenever a file is added, checked out, or checked in to a vault.NOTE:Because SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional cannot force a reload of
add-ins if they are written in .NET, all client machines must be restarted to ensure that the latest version of the add-in is used.

1. Follow

  [Creating Menu Commands (C#)](csharpmenuitem.htm)

  to create a basic add-in.
2. In your add-in's

  [IEdmAddIn5::GetAddInInfo](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmAddIn5~GetAddInInfo.html)

  implementation, c

  all

  [IEdmCmdMgr5::AddHook](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmCmdMgr5~AddHook.html)

  for each SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional activity that you want your add-in to be
  notified about. Implement IEdmAddIn5::GetAddInInfo as follows:
3. Implement IEdmAddIn5::OnCmd as follows:
4. Click Build > Build
  Solution to build the add-in.
5. I

  nstall
  the add-in through the SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional
  Administration tool:

  1. Open

    the SOLIDWORKS
    PDM Professional Administration tool.
  2. Expand the vault where
    you want to install this add-in and log in as Admin.
  3. Right-click

    Add-ins

    and click

    New
    Add-in

    .
  4. B

    rowse to

    project_path

    \

    project_name\project_name

    \bin\Debug

    ,
    click

    project_name

    .dll

    and

    EPDM.Interop.epdm.dll

    .
  5. Click

    Open

    .
  6. Click

    OK

    .
  7. Click

    OK

    .
6. Add, check out, or check in
  one or more vault files. A message box displays with the files
  added, checked out, or checked in.

**NOTE:**OnCmd is not called during check-in if the
file is not modified. During check-in of unmodified
files, SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional triggers an "undo check-out" event. To handle
this "undo check-out" event, register EdmCmdType.EdmCmd_PreUndoLock and EdmCmdType.EdmCmd_PostUndoLock hooks in your add-in's implementation of IEdmAddIn5::GetAddInInfo.
