# Writing 64-bit Add-ins

This topic shows how to createadd-ins for the 64-bit version of SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional.

64-bit .NET
Add-ins

You must
use Microsoft Visual Studio 2005, or later, to create managed (.NET) DLL add-ins.
The build target must be set to Any CPU for the DLL to load
in both 32-bit and 64-bit hosts. Managed DLL add-ins are added to the
vault using the Administration tool .

Native
DLL Add-ins

A native
32-bit DLL cannot be loaded into a 64-bit EXE, and a 64-bit native DLL cannot be
loaded into a 32-bit EXE. Because SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional gets loaded into both 32-
and 64-bit processes, you must build two versions of your add-in, 32-bit and
64-bit.

Native DLL
add-ins that are added to the vault on a 64-bit machine also work on a 32-bit
machine:

1. Right-click

  the

  Add-ins

  node in the Administration tool.
2. Select

  New

  Add-in

  .
3. Navigate to and open

  the 64-bit add-in DLL.
4. In the Properties dialog, select

  Files

  in the left pane.
5. Click

  Add Files

  .
6. Navigate to and open

  the 32-bit add-in DLL.
7. Click

  OK

  .

SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional creates a single add-in package that contains both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the add-in. The 32-bit version is loaded
in 32-bit processes, and the 64-bit version is loaded in 64-bit processes.
