# Standard Task Add-in

You can write your own

[task](Tasks.htm)

add-in using SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional API's methods and
interfaces. Doing so gives you full control over what the task should do.

However, if
you simply want a task to open files in SOLIDWORKS and run VBScripts on
them, then you can reuse the standard task add-in shipped with SOLIDWORKS PDM
Professional. The standard task add-in provides two tasks:

- Printing files
  using SOLIDWORKS.
- Converting
  SOLIDWORKS files to other file formats.

Additionally you can modify the
standard task add-in to execute any script.

1. Make sure that
  the add-in, SWTaskAddIn, is installed in the vault.
2. Start the
  Administration tool, right-click

  Tasks

  in the tree, and select

  New Task

  .
3. Select the
  SWTaskAddIn add-in in the first page of the dialog box

  .
4. Go to the Script
  page and edit the code in the main function.

  The

  Insert Macro

  button makes it possible to insert macros that
  will be replaced with data from SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional when the
  script is executed.

  Read more
  about macros in the following section.
5. Set all other
  tasks settings, such as computer on which to execute, notifications,
  etc.

### Macros

The macros in the Insert
Macro menu work inconsistently. Keep in mind:

| Menu Option | Macro | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source File Name | <Filename> | This option is added as the literal string "<Filename>" to the script.
The script has to scan for the string and replace it with the real file
name. |
| Source File Extension | <Extension> | This option works like <Filename> in the sense that the macro is not
resolved. |
| Configuration Name | <Configuration> | This option works like <Filename> in the sense that the macro is not
resolved. |
| Source Folder Path | <Path> | This
macro will be replaced with the file system path to the parent folder of
the source file. Add double quotes around "<Path>" to use it as a
string. Example: C:\MyVault\Drawings\ |
| Vault Root Folder Path | <VaultPath> | Resolves to the root folder of the vault. For instance: C:\MyVault\ |
| Task Instance GUID | <TaskInstanceGuid> | A GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) that identifies the task instance. |
| Source File Path | <Filepath> | Resolves to the full path to the source file. Example: C:\MyVault\Drawings\Part.sldprt |

You can
create an input card using the card editor to provide a user interface when
the task is launched. The data entered in the card can then be used in the
script. Refer to a card variable value in the script by enclosing it with {
}, for example {Description}, to insert a value from variable, Description. It is a good idea to have a look at the scripts for printing and converting,
which are shipped with SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional, for hints on how to write
scripts. The SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional Help contains additional information
about the Administration tool and using the standard task add-in.
