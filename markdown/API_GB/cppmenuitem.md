# Creating Menu Commands (C++)

This topic shows how to create a
C++ add-in in Microsoft Visual Studio that adds menu commands to the
context-sensitive and Tools menus of vaults in File
Explorer.

1. Createan add-in as described in the basic framework sample .

1. Replace your add-in's implementation of IEdmAddIn5::GetAddInInfo with the following code:

STDMETHOD(GetAddInInfo)(EdmAddInInfo
* poInfo, IEdmVault5 * poVault, IEdmCmdMgr5 * poCmdMgr) { //The AFX_MANAGE_STATE macro is needed for MFC
applications but should not //be used for applications that are MFC-free. AFX_MANAGE_STATE(AfxGetStaticModuleState()); if (poInfo == NULL || poCmdMgr == NULL ) return E_POINTER; //Return some information for the
Administrate Add-ins dialog box poInfo->mbsAddInName = SysAllocString( L"Menu command
sample" ); poInfo->mbsCompany = SysAllocString( L"SOLIDWORKS Corporation"
); poInfo->mbsDescription= SysAllocString( L"Adds menu items" ); poInfo->mlAddInVersion = 1; //SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 5.2 or later is required to
install this add-in poInfo->mlRequiredVersionMajor = 5; poInfo->mlRequiredVersionMinor = 2; //Add a command for each of the buttons
(the command ID numbers 1000 and 1001 are //arbitrary; SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional
does not use them; instead, it only passes them to
your //implementation of OnCmd so that it knows which command was selected) poCmdMgr->AddCmd( 1000, bstr_t("First command"),
EdmMenu_Nothing,

bstr_t("This
is the first command"),

bstr_t("First command"), -1, 0 ); poCmdMgr->AddCmd( 1001, bstr_t("Second command"),
EdmMenu_MustHaveSelection,

bstr_t("This
is the second command"),

bstr_t("Second command"), -1, 0 ); return S_OK; }

The flag EdmMenuFlags.EdmMenu_MustHaveSelection indicates that only the second command is available to the user if the user
selects one or more files or folders.

1. Replace your add-in's implementation ofIEdmAdd5::OnCmd with the following code:

  STDMETHOD(OnCmd)(EdmCmd *
  poCmd, SAFEARRAY * * ppoData) { //The AFX_MANAGE_STATE macro is needed for MFC
  applications but should not //be used for applications that are MFC-free AFX_MANAGE_STATE(AfxGetStaticModuleState()); if (poCmd == NULL ||ppoData == NULL) return E_POINTER; //Check the command ID to see which
  command was selected //(this only affects the caption of the message box below) CString oName; if( poCmd->mlCmdID = = 1000 ) oName = "The first command"; else oName = "The second command"; if( SafeArrayGetDim( *ppoData ) != 1 ) return E_INVALIDARG; //Get a pointer to the actual array
  elements EdmCmdData *poElements = NULL; HRESULT hRes = SafeArrayAccessData( *ppoData, (void**)&poElements
  ); if( FAILED(hRes) ) return hRes; //Create a message showing the names and
  IDs of all selected files and folders CString oRow; CString oMessage = "You have selected the following files and
  folders:\n"; int iCount=(*ppoData)->rgsabound->cElements; for( int i = 0; i < iCount; ++i ) { if(poElements->mlObjectID1 == 0 ) { oRow.Format( "Folder: (ID= %d)
  ",poElements->mlObjectID2 ); } else { oRow.Format( "File: (ID= %d)
  ",poElements->mlObjectID1 ); } oMessage += oRow + (LPCTSTR)bstr_t(poElements->mbsStrData1
  ); oMessage += "\n"; ++poElements; } //Release the array data and display the
  message SafeArrayUnaccessData( *ppoData ); MessageBox((HWND)poCmd->mlParentWnd, oMessage, oName, MB_OK ); return S_OK; }
2. Save and compile the project.
3. Add the add-in DLL to the
  file vault using theAdministration tool .
4. The first menu command appears in
  thecontext-sensitive and Tools menus of vaults in File Explorer. The second menu command appears in the context-sensitive menus
  only when one or
  more files or folders are selected.Right-click a file in the vault
  andselect Second command . A dialog
  similar to the following is displayed:
