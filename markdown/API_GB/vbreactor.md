# Creating Add-in Hooks (VB.NET)

This
topic shows how to implement IEdmAddIn5::GetAddInInfo and IEdmAddIn5::OnCmd in your add-in to have SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional notify your add-in
whenever a file is added, checked out, or checked in.NOTE:Because SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional cannot force a reload of
add-ins if they are written in .NET, all client machines must be restarted to ensure that the latest version of the add-in is used.

1. C

  all

  [IEdmCmdMgr5::AddHook](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmCmdMgr5~AddHook.html)

  from your add-in's GetAddInInfo
  method
  for each activity you want your add-in to know about. Implement IEdmAddIn5::GetAddInInfo
  in your add-in as follows:
2. Implement
  IEdmAddIn5::OnCmd in
  your add-in as follows:
3. Click Build > Build
  Solution to build the add-in.
4. I

  nstall
  the add-in through the SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional
  Administration tool:

  1. Open

    the SOLIDWORKS
    PDM Professional Administration tool.
  2. Expand the vault where
    you want to install this add-in and log in as Admin.
  3. Right-click

    Add-ins

    and click

    New
    Add-in

    .
  4. B

    rowse to

    project_path

    \

    project_name\project_name

    \bin\Debug

    ,
    click

    project_name

    .dll

    and

    EPDM.Interop.epdm.dll

    .
  5. Click

    Open

    .
  6. Click

    OK

    .
  7. Click

    OK

    .
5. Try adding, checking out, and checking in
  vault files.

**NOTE:**OnCmd is not called during check-in if the
file is not modified before it is checked in. During check-in of unmodified
files, SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional triggers an "undo check-out" event. To handle
this "undo check-out" event, add hooks for EdmCmdType.EdmCmd_PreUndoLock and EdmCmdType.EdmCmd_PostUndoLock to your add-in's GetAddInInfo.
