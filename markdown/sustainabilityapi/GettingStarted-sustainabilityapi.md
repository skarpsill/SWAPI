# Getting Started

Writing a SOLIDWORKS Sustainability API application typically involves:

1. Adding a reference to either the SOLIDWORKS Sustainability API type library or primary interop assembly:

  - VBA:

    sustainability

    version

    Type Library

    or

    install_dir

    \

    sustainability.tlb

    .
  - C# or VB.NET:

    SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sustainability

    or

    install_dir

    \

    api\redist\SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sustainability.dll

    .

    NOTE

    :

    install_dir

    is typically

    C:\Program Files\SOLIDWORKS Corp\SOLIDWORKS

    .
2. Opening a part or assembly document.
3. Getting the model document object,

  [IModelDoc2](ms-its:sldworksapi.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2.html)

  .
4. Calling

  [IModelDocExtension::GetSustainability](ms-its:sldworksapi.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~GetSustainability.html)

  to get the entry point to the SOLIDWORKS Sustainability API,

  [ISustainabilityApp](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sustainability~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sustainability.ISustainabilityApp.html)

  .
5. Getting and setting environmental impact factors:

  | For document type... | To get or set this environmental impact factor... | Call... |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Parts | Material | ISustainabilityApp::GetSustainabilityMaterial |
  |  | Manufacture | ISustainabilityApp::GetSustainabilityManufacturing |
  |  | Region of use | ISustainabilityApp::GetSustainabilityPartUse |
  |  | Transportation | ISustainabilityApp::GetSustainabilityTransportation |
  |  | End of Life | ISustainabilityApp::GetSustainabilityEndOfLife |
  |  |  |  |
  | Assemblies | Material of components | ISustainabilityApp::GetSustainabilityMaterial |
  |  | Manufacture of components | ISustainabilityApp::GetSustainabilityManufacturing |
  |  | Assembly | ISustainabilityApp::GetSustainabilityAssemblyProcess |
  |  | Region of use and energy consumption | ISustainabilityApp::GetSustainabilityAssemblyUse |
  |  | Transportation | ISustainabilityApp::GetSustainabilityTransportation |
  |  | End of Life | ISustainabilityApp::GetSustainabilityEndOfLife |
6. Specifying the

  [amount of product use time](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sustainability~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sustainability.ISustainabilityEnvironmentalImpact~DurationOfUse.html)

  over which to evaluate environmental impact.
7. Specifying the

  [units](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sustainability~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sustainability.ISustainabilityEnvironmentalImpact~DurationType.html)

  of time over which to evaluate environmental impact.
8. [Updating the environmental impact results](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sustainability~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sustainability.ISustainabilityEnvironmentalImpact~UpdateResults.html)

  .
9. Obtaining the environmental impact of a part or assembly in terms of

  [air acidification](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sustainability~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sustainability.ISustainabilityEnvironmentalImpact~GetAirAcidification.html)

  ,

  [carbon footprint](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sustainability~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sustainability.ISustainabilityEnvironmentalImpact~GetCurrentCarbonFootPrint.html)

  ,

  [energy consumption](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sustainability~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sustainability.ISustainabilityEnvironmentalImpact~GetEnergyConsumption.html)

  , and

  [water eutrophication](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sustainability~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sustainability.ISustainabilityEnvironmentalImpact~GetWaterEutrophication.html)

  .
