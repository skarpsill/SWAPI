# Administration Menu for Add-ins

An add-in
often contains commands intended both for end users and the administrator of
the system. You can add these commands as menu items using the

[IEdmCmdMgr5::AddCmd](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmCmdMgr5~AddCmd.html)

method. The downside to this is that the
administrator commands are displayed in the File Explorer and, unless you
check the logged-in user, all users are able to run the administrator
commands.

In
SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 6.4, a new flag is added to IEdmCmdMgr5::AddCmd, EdmMenuFlags::EdmMenu_Administration ,
which controls whether a
menu command is hidden in the File Explorer. When the flag is
set, the command is displayed only in SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional’s Administration
tool when you right-click the add-in.
