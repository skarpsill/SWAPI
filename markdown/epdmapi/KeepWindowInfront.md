# Keeping Add-in Windows in the Foreground

When
an add-in displays a dialog box, the add-in needs to keep the dialog box in
front of whatever window launched it. Failure to do so may result
in the dialog box disappearing and the user
becoming confused.

### C++

To keep the dialog box in the foreground, you can
specify a
parent window handle when the new dialog box is created.

### VB.NET or C#

Window handling is supported in SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 6.4 and later. In SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 6.4 only, you must also enable the
Multithreaded Add-ins Threading policy.

Unlike Visual Basic 6,VB.NET and C# allow you to create add-in modules that support
multi-threading. When SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional runs a multi-threaded NET add-in, it executes it in the same thread
as the parent window. Calls to IEdmVault5::SetAddInWnd ,
which were previously recommended for Visual Basic 6, are no longer necessary.

To keep an add-in window in the foreground, call IEdmVault8::GetWin32Window in the .NET form of your add-in to specify the handle of the parent window.
