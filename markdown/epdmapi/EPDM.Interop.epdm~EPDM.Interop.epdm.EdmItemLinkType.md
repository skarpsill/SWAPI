| EdmItemLnk_Attachment | 1 = Attachment links are referred to as static links in the user interface; a statically linked file does not drive the associated item; it is just an attachment |
| EdmItemLnk_Dynamic | 0 = Dynamic links are referred to as auto-update links in the user interface in SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 2010 and later; this means that some changes in the linked file automatically propagates to the item |
