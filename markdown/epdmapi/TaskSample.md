# Task Add-in Sample

The following shows the entire source code of a task add-in
written in VB.NET. The add-in:

- Implements

  [IEdmAddIn5](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmAddIn5.html)

  .
- Creates custom pages in the Task property dialog box.
- Customizes the task details page.
- Displays a user interface on launch.

NOTE: To populate the GUID attribute below, click**Tools > Create GUID**in the IDE, select GUID Format 6, click**Copy**, and click**Exit**.
Replace <Guid("")>
with the copied string.

The following is a resource template of the custom set-up page that is displayed
in the Task property dialog box by TaskAddIn::OnTaskSetup .
It is a user control in Visual Studio with an edit box named TextBox1 and a
button named TestButton.

The code behind the custom set-up page is as follows.

Imports EPDM.Interop.epdm Public Class SetupPage 'Button handler for a button on the page Private Sub TestButton_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)
Handles TestButton.Click MsgBox("You pressed the test button") End Sub

Public Sub LoadData(ByRef poCmd As

[EdmCmd](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmd.html)

)

'Get the property interface used to
access the framework

Dim props As

[IEdmTaskProperties](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmTaskProperties.html)

props = poCmd.mpoExtra

'Populate the edit box from a variable

TextBox1.Text = props.GetValEx("MyTestSetupVar")

End Sub

Public Sub StoreData(ByRef
poCmd As

[EdmCmd](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.EdmCmd.html)

)

'Get the property interface used to access the
framework

Dim props As

[IEdmTaskProperties](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmTaskProperties.html)

props = poCmd.mpoExtra

'Make sure the user has typed a value in the
edit box

If TextBox1.Text = "" Then

MsgBox("Enter a test value for the add-in!")

poCmd.mbCancel = True

Exit Sub

End If

'Save the value entered by the user

props.SetValEx("MyTestSetupVar", TextBox1.Text)

End Sub

End Class

The following
is the resource
template of the extra details page added by TaskAddIn::OnTaskDetails . It is a user control in Visual Studio that displays two task variables:

The code behind the extra details
page:

Imports EPDM.Interop.epdm Public Class TaskDetailsPage Public Sub LoadData(ByRef inst As IEdmTaskInstance) 'Populate the editboxes from the variables in the task TextBoxSetupVar.Text = CStr(inst.GetValEx("MyTestSetupVar")) TextBoxLaunchVar.Text = CStr(inst.GetValEx("MyLaunchVar")) End Sub End Class

The following is the set-up page
when the add-in is used in a task.

The following is the task details
page when opened from the task list.

The following is the task list during task execution.
