# State Property (IEdmSearch5)

Gets or sets the ID or name of the workflow state in which to search.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic

```vb
Property State As System.Object
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object State {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.Object^ State {
   System.Object^ get();
   void set (    System.Object^ value);
}
```

### Property Value

ID or name of the workflow state in which to search

## Remarks

If the search object was obtained using:

- [IEdmVault21::CreateSearch2](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmVault21~CreateSearch2.html)

  (

  [IEdmSearch9](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmSearch9.html)

  ), then the workflow state name may require extended search syntax. (See

  [Search Syntax](SearchSyntax-epdmapi.html)

  .)

- [IEdmVault5::CreateSearch](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmVault5~CreateSearch.html)

  , then the workflow state name for which to search may contain a % wildcard character. For example,

  test

  searches for all files that have a workflow state that contains the word, test.

  % indicates any sequence of characters of any length. You can also use underscore (_) as a wildcard for exactly one arbitrary character.

  To search for strings containing the actual characters '%' and '_', enclose them in brackets [...]:

  my[_]text[%]file.txt

  You can also enclose the entire string in brackets, because no wildcards occur in it:

  [my_text%file.txt]
