Dim instance As IDimXpertCompoundHoleFeature
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.GetSubFeatures()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object GetSubFeatures()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ GetSubFeatures();
```

### Return Value

Array of

[IDimXpertFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swdimxpert~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swdimxpert.IDimXpertFeature.html)

## Remarks

This method returns all sub-features of the hole feature. All of the sub-features returned by this method do not appear on the DimXpertManager tab of the Management Panel. Functional geometry sub-features such as planes and cylinders that represent each individual face of a part are for internal use only. These sub-features do not appear in the DimXpertManager tree. However, manufacturing sub-features that are significant for downstream machining and inspection do appear in the DimXpertManager tree.

For example, the sub-features of a simple hole are related to functional geometry and are not listed in the DimXpertManager tree. However, the sub-features of a hole pattern are manufacturing features (e.g., simple holes) that are significant for downstream processes. These manufacturing features are listed in the DimXpertManager tree.
