# Get and Set Pattern Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to get
and set DimXpert pattern features.

```vb
 '---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
 ' 1. Open: public_documents\samples\tutorial\dimxpert\bracket_auto_manual.sldprt.
 ' 2. Select one of the CBORE hole faces in the SOLIDWORKS viewer.
 ' 3. Open an Immediate window.
 ' 4. Ensure that the latest SOLIDWORKS DimXpert interop assembly is referenced:
 '    a. Right-click the project in Project Explorer.
 '    b. Select Add Reference.
 '    c. Click the Browse tab.
 '    d. Find and select install_dir\api\redist\swdimxpert.dll.

 '
 ' Postconditions: Inspect the Immediate window and the DimXpertManager tab.
 '
 ' NOTE: Because this part is used elsewhere, do not save changes.
