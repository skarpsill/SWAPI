# GetNominalTopPlane Method (IDimXpertCompoundClosedSlot3DFeature)

Gets the coordinates and vector for the top reference plane of this DimXpert compound closed slot.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetNominalTopPlane( _
   ByRef X As System.Double, _
   ByRef Y As System.Double, _
   ByRef Z As System.Double, _
   ByRef I As System.Double, _
   ByRef J As System.Double, _
   ByRef K As System.Double _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IDimXpertCompoundClosedSlot3DFeature
Dim X As System.Double
Dim Y As System.Double
Dim Z As System.Double
Dim I As System.Double
Dim J As System.Double
Dim K As System.Double
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.GetNominalTopPlane(X, Y, Z, I, J, K)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool GetNominalTopPlane(
   out System.double X,
   out System.double Y,
   out System.double Z,
   out System.double I,
   out System.double J,
   out System.double K
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool GetNominalTopPlane(
   [Out] System.double X,
   [Out] System.double Y,
   [Out] System.double Z,
   [Out] System.double I,
   [Out] System.double J,
   [Out] System.double K
)
```

### Parameters

- `X`: X-coordinate of the top reference plane
- `Y`: Y-coordinate of the top reference plane
- `Z`: Z-coordinate of the top reference plane
- `I`: I component of the direction vector of the top reference plane
- `J`: J component of the direction vector of the top reference plane
- `K`: K component of the direction vector of the top reference plane

### Return Value

True if method call is successful; false otherwise
