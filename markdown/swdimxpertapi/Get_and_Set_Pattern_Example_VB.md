# Get and Set Pattern Example (VBA)

This example shows how to get and set DimXpert pattern
features.

```vb
 '---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
' 1. Open public_documents\samples\tutorial\dimxpert\bracket_auto_manual.sldprt.
 ' 2. Select one of the CBORE hole faces in the SOLIDWORKS viewer.
 ' 3. Open an Immediate window .
 ' 4. Ensure that the latest SOLIDWORKS DimXpert type library is loaded:
 '    a. Select Tools > References.
 '    b. Click Browse.
 '    c. Find and select install_dir\swdimxpert.tlb.
 '
 ' Postconditions: Inspect the Immediate Window and the DimXpertManager tab.
 '
 ' NOTE: Because this part is used elsewhere, do not save changes.
