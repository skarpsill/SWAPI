# Set User-defined Route Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to:

- set the type of route of the active
  component to user defined.
- get and set the name and cross-section
  type of the user-defined route of an active component.

```
'-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Add SOLIDWORKS Routing as an add-in
'   (in SOLIDWORKS click Tools > Add-Ins > SOLIDWORKS Routing).
' 2. Add SOLIDWORKS.interop.SwRoutingLib.dll as a reference
'   (in the IDE right-click the project,
'    click Add Reference, and browse to install_dir\api\redist).
' 3. In Tools > Options > System Options > Routing > Routing File Locations,
'    add the locations of your SOLIDWORKS Routing files.
' 4. Open an assembly containing a route that has rectangular sections.
' 5. Open an Immediate Window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Sets the active component's route to user defined.
' 2. Gets and sets the active component's user-defined route's
'    name and cross-section type.
' 3. Examine the Immediate window.
