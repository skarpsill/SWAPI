# Select Connector Using Highlight Search Tool Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to select a connector using the SOLIDWORKS Routing
Highlight Search tool.

```vb
  '----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
  ' 1. Open an assembly document containing an electrical route and
 '    connector (3pin) female-1.
 ' 2. In SOLIDWORKS, select Tools > Add-Ins > SOLIDWORKS Routing.
  ' 3. In Tools > Options > System Options > Routing > Routing File Locations,
  '    click Launch Routing Library Manager and set the locations of your
 '    SOLIDWORKS Routing files.
 ' 4. In the IDE, right-click the project,
 '    click Add Reference, browse install_dir\api\redist, select
 '    SolidWorks.Interop.SwRoutingLib.dll, and click OK.
 ' 5. Open an Immediate window.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1. Finds the specified component.
  ' 2. Prints the number of instances of the specified component.
 ' 3. Selects the component in the FeatureManager design tree.
  ' 4. Prints the number of components attached to the selected component.
  ' 5. Colors the selected component gray in the graphics area.
 ' 6. Inspect the Immediate window, the FeatureManager design tree,
 '    and the graphics area.
