) As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IWire
Dim RouteSegmentIDs As System.Object
Dim value As System.Integer

value = instance.SetRoutePathForWire(RouteSegmentIDs)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int SetRoutePathForWire(
   System.object RouteSegmentIDs
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.int SetRoutePathForWire(
   System.Object^ RouteSegmentIDs
)
```

### Parameters

- `RouteSegmentIDs`: Array of route segment IDs (see

Remarks

)

### Return Value

Status of setting a new route path as defined in

[swSetRoutePathForWireErrorType_e](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.SWRoutingLib~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.SWRoutingLib.swSetRoutePathForWireErrorType_e.html)

[Set New Route Paths for Wires (VBA)](Set_New_Route_Paths_for_Wires_Example_VB.htm)

## Remarks

This method checks to see if the route segment IDs are valid. If so, then the existing wire path is cleared and a new wire path with new route segments is created.

You can pass new route segments by either:

- preselecting the route segments or preselecting two connectors. This method automatically detects the route segments between the two selected connectors.

  - or -
- Passing an array of route segment IDs.
