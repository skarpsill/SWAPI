## Members

| Member | Description |
| --- | --- |
| swAutodimStatus3DSketchNotSupported | 5 = Cannot autodimension a 3D sketch |
| swAutodimStatusAlgorithmFailed | 17 = Unspecified algorithm failure |
| swAutodimStatusBadOptionValue | 1 = An option value for an argument is out of range |
| swAutodimStatusCenterlineNotAllowed | 10 = The centerline scheme is not valid for sketches that cannot be revolved to create valid features |
| swAutodimStatusDatumLineNotCenterline | 14 = The datum must be a centerline for the centerline scheme |
| swAutodimStatusDatumLineNotHorizontal | 16 = If the sketch line is a datum, it must be horizontal for horizontal dimensions |
| swAutodimStatusDatumLineNotVertical | 15 = If the sketch line is a datum, it must be vertical for vertical dimension |
| swAutodimStatusDatumNotSupplied | 11 = No datum was selected for either the horizontal or vertical dimensioning schemes |
| swAutodimStatusDatumNotUnique | 12 = More than one datum was selected for either the horizontal or vertical dimensioning schemes |
| swAutodimStatusDatumNotValidType | 13 = One of the selected datums is not valid. Valid types are sketch points and sketch lines |
| swAutodimStatusDocTypeNotSupported | 3 = Only part and assemblies documents are supported |
| swAutodimStatusEntitiesNotValid | 9 = The entitiesToDimension argument has the value of swAutodimEntitiesSelected , but the marked entities are not valid |
| swAutodimStatusNoActiveDoc | 2 = No active document |
| swAutodimStatusNoActiveSketch | 4 = Can only autodimension an active sketch |
| swAutodimStatusNoEntities | 8 = The entitiesToDimension argument has the value of swAutodimEntitiesSelected , but no entities were selected and marked with the value swAutodimMarkEntities |
| swAutodimStatusSketchIsEmpty | 6 = Cannot autodimension an empty sketch |
| swAutodimStatusSketchIsOverDefined | 7 = Cannot autodimension an over defined sketch |
| swAutodimStatusSketchNoSolutionFound | 18 = Cannot autodimension a sketch for which there is no solution |
| swAutodimStatusSuccess | 0 = Sketch successfully dimensioned |
