# Context-Sensitive SOLIDWORKS API Help

Context-sensitive SOLIDWORKS API help is available as you edit SOLIDWORKS VBA and .NET
macros.

To see context-sensitive SOLIDWORKS API help:

1. Select a SOLIDWORKS API (interface, method, property, or enumerator) in
  the editor (VBA or VSTA or Visual Studio).
2. Press F1.

As of SOLIDWORKS 2018, if you have Visual Studio 2015 installed,
context-sensitive API help for .NET displays in the Microsoft Help Viewer. When
you install SOLIDWORKS 2018 or later, SOLIDWORKS API and enumerator helps are
registered and integrated with the Help Viewer catalogs of the Visual Studio
installed on your machine. After installing SOLIDWORKS 2018, configure
Visual Studio to launch Help Viewer help by selecting**Help > Help
Preference > Launch in Help Viewer**.

Please note:

- Help Viewer SOLIDWORKS API help (

  *.cab

  and

  *.msha

  ) for users of Visual Studio
  2012, 2013, or 2015

  is delivered in

  install_dir/

  api/HelpViewer

  .
- HTML 2.0 compiled SOLIDWORKS API help for users of VSTA and Visual
  Studio versions earlier than 2015 is
  delivered in

  install_dir/

  api/HTMLHelp2x

  .
- HTML 1.0 compiled SOLIDWORKS API help for users of VBA is
  delivered in

  install_dir

  /

  api

  .

When you press F1 while editing:

- VBA macros, HTML 1.0 compiled help displays.
- VB.NET and C# macros in VSTA 1.0, HTML 2.0 compiled help
  displays.
- VB.NET and C# programs in Visual Studio (2012, 2013),
  either Help Viewer help or HTML 2.0 compiled help displays. Configure Visual
  Studio to launch either the Help Viewer or a browser before using F1.
- VB.NET and C# programs in Visual Studio 2015, only Help Viewer
  help can display. You must configure Visual Studio 2015 to launch the Help
  Viewer before using F1.
- VB.NET and C# macros or programs in Visual Studio 2015, example links in the
  displayed help do not work. You must open local help to see examples.

If after installing SOLIDWORKS, F1 does not display help for SOLIDWORKS APIs in
.NET macros, try manually
registering the SOLIDWORKS API Help with Help Viewer.
