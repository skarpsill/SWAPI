# SOLIDWORKS Macros

The quickest and easiest way to start programming with the SOLIDWORKS
API is to record a SOLIDWORKS macro, which contains the SOLIDWORKS API
calls that correspond to the actions performed in the user interface.
You can modify the macro in Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)
or Microsoft Visual Studio Tools for Applications (VSTA) to fit your work
site's needs.

- Microsoft VBAis a toolset based on Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and
  is embedded in the SOLIDWORKS software. Microsoft VBA lets you record,
  run, and edit Microsoft VBA macros in the SOLIDWORKS software. Recorded
  macros are saved as.swpfiles.
- Microsoft Visual
  Studio Tools for Applications (VSTA)is a toolset based on Microsoft VB.NET and C# and is delivered with the SOLIDWORKS
  software. Microsoft VSTA lets you record, edit, debug, and run VB.NET and C#
  code with the SOLIDWORKS software. Recorded Microsoft VSTA macros are saved
  as Microsoft VB.NET or C# projects. Building or debugging a Microsoft VSTA macro creates an executable file that ends in the filename extension.dll,which can be used by the SOLIDWORKS software in the same manner as a.swpfile.NOTES:

  - [SOLIDWORKS 2018 offers Visual Studio Tools for
    Applications (VSTA)](VSTA_2015.htm)

    , impacting how VB.NET and C# macros are developed and
    run in SOLIDWORKS 2018 and later.
  - When debugging Microsoft VSTA macros with user-interface
    components such as PropertyManager pages, manipulators, or other objects
    that use events or handler objects, the debugger must continue to run
    after the main() method of the VSTA macro exits. Either deselect the user-interface
    system option

    Stop VSTA debugger on macro
    exit

    (located on the

    Tools >

    Options >

    System

    Options

    dialog) or set swUserPreferenceToggle_e.swStopDebuggingVstaOnExit
    to false to keep the debugger running after the main() method of the Microsoft
    VSTA macro exits.

Typically you would follow these steps to create a SOLIDWORKS API application
using SOLIDWORKS macros:

1. Plan the user-interface actions before recording
  them.
2. [Record](Record_Solidworks_Macro.htm)the user-interface actions.NOTE:If you are not familiar with recording SOLIDWORKS macros,
  record the macro a couple of times to eliminate interactive changes to
  the view such as changing the view orientation, zooming in or out, panning,
  rotating the model, and so on.
3. [Edit](Edit_or_Debug_SolidWorks_Macro.htm)the macro to delete extra lines of code and explicitly declare and early
  bind variables.
4. [Run](Run_SolidWorks_Macro.htm)the
  macro to test it.
5. [Debug](Edit_or_Debug_SolidWorks_Macro.htm)the macro and test it again.
6. If the application has a user interface, create
  it in Microsoft VBA or Microsoft VSTA and then modify the macro to work
  with the user interface, run the modified macro, and debug it.

When done recording, testing, and debugging the macro, you can[assign
the macro to button](Assign_SolidWorks_Macro_to_Button.htm).
