# SOLIDWORKS API Object Model Overview

The[ISldWorks](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.ISldWorks.html)object is the application object; it is the top-level object in the SOLIDWORKS
API object hierarchy. All of the other SOLIDWORKS objects are located
below the ISldWorks object in the object hierarchy and can be accessed
directly or indirectly.

**For compiled help (*.chm):**Each interface's help topic
contains an**Access Diagram**section. Click the link in this
section to open that interface's access diagram.

**For web help
only:**Open the**Access Diagram**by clicking the**ISldWorks > Access Diagram > SldWorks (web help only)**link. Navigate to
other objects from there.

If an object can only be accessed indirectly, then you must reference
that object from another object higher in the object hierarchy. For example,
the[ISketchSpline](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.ISketchSpline.html)object can only be accessed indirectly; it cannot exist on its own. You
must reference the ISketchSpline object from the[ISketchSegment](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.ISketchSegment.html)object because it exists only within the context of the ISketchSegment
object.

Most of the SOLIDWORKS API objects correspond to user-interface functionality;
however, several SOLIDWORKS API objects provide functionality only accessible
through the SOLIDWORKS API. For example, the[IFeature](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IFeature.html)object lets you access features in the FeatureManager design tree,
but the[IAttribute](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IAttribute.html)object is a SOLIDWORKS API-only object because there is no corresponding
user-interface functionality.
