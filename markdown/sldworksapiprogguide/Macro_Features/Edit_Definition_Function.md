# Edit Definition Function

The edit definition function for a macro feature:

- Obtains the[IMacroFeatureData](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IMacroFeatureData.html)object from the input[IFeature](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IFeature.html)object
- Obtains the selections and parameters from the
  IMacroFeatureData object
- Calls[IMacroFeatureData::AccessSelections](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IMacroFeatureData~AccessSelections.html)or[IMacroFeatureData::IAccessSelections
  to put SOLIDWORKS in a rollback state](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IMacroFeatureData~IAccessSelections.html)
- Provides a user interface, which:

  - allows the user to change the selections.
  - allows the user to modify the input data.
  - modifies features; possibly allows the user to change the input body.
  - creates features; ensures that IMacroFeatureData::EditBodies or
    IMacroFeatureData::IGetEditBodies is Nothing.
- Sets all of the selections and parameters back
  into the IMacroFeatureData object
- Calls[IFeature::ModifyDefinition](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html)or[IFeature::IModifyDefinition2](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IFeature~IModifyDefinition2.html)on the input feature, which flags the feature as dirty and needing a rebuild

The edit definition function is called by SOLIDWORKS whenever the user
edits the definition of a macro feature. This function should handle all
user-interface activity needed for acquiring and editing selections and
parametric data for the macro feature. The[IPropertyManagerPage2](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IPropertyManagerPage2.html)interface is well suited for handling the user interaction, but it is
not required. Other user interface options are VBA UserForm or an external
application.

The data should be stored using the macro feature’s IMacroFeatureData
interface. User inputs should be validated and body operations checked
before calling[IFeature::ModifyDefinition](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html)or[IFeature::IModifyDefinition2](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IFeature~IModifyDefinition2.html),
which causes the macro feature[rebuild
function](Rebuild_Function.htm)to be called.

The following example illustrates an VBA-based edit definition function.

Function swmEdit(app As Variant, part As
Variant, feature As Variant) As Variant

msgbox "Edit definition function called."

.

.

.

swmEdit= True

End Function
