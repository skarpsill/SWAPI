# Rebuild Function

The rebuild function for a macro feature performs the real work. No
new features can be introduced and no user interaction can occur during
a rebuild of a model containing a macro feature.

There are three types of rebuild functions:

(Table)=========================================================

| Type | Definition | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Independent | Interacts with the model, but does not modify existing geometry or create
new geometry | Obtains the IMacroFeatureData object from the input IFeature
object Obtains the selections and parameters from the
IMacroFeatureData object Processes the inputs according to the design of
the feature Validates data based on the model Updates external databases Return values can be: True, which indicates success False, which indicates failure with no additional
information String, which is displayed in an error message
to the user; for example: VBA s wmRebuild =
"Macro feature output error message" C++ COM CComBSTR bMsg = _T("Macro feature output error message"); _variant_t vBSTRRet = bMsg; *retval = vBSTRRet; C# functionReturnValue = "Macro feature output error message"; return functionReturnValue; VB.NET Regenerate = "Macro feature output error message" |
| Modify | Modifies one or more input bodies | Obtains the IMacroFeatureData from the input feature Obtains the bodies to modify from IMacroFeatureData::EditBodies or IMacroFeatureData::IGetEditBodies Obtains the selections and parameters from the
IMacroFeatureData object Processes the inputs according to the design of
the feature Copies any selected object for use with the input
body Creates any new geometry based on the input data Modifies the input bodies Calls IMacroFeatureData::GetEntitiesNeedUserId on the input body Gets any faces or edges
that need IDs Places IDs using IMacroFeatureData::SetFaceUserId and IMacroFeatureData::SetEdgeUserId ,
respectively NOTE :
The numbering scheme should be consistent and reproducible. Return values can be: True, which indicates success False, which indicates failure and no additional
information is provided String, which is displayed in an error message
to the user; for example: VBA swmRebuild = "Macro
feature output error message" C++ COM CComBSTR bMsg = _T("Macro feature output error message"); _variant_t vBSTRRet = bMsg; *retval = vBSTRRet; C# functionReturnValue =
"Macro feature output error message"; return functionReturnValue; VB.NET Regenerate = "Macro feature output error message" NOTE: A macro feature rebuild function can output more than one body,
in a VARIANT SafeArray containing multiple IBody2 objects, by either modifying
one or more edit bodies or by creating one or more new bodies. For multibody
macro features only, call IMacroFeatureData::EnableMultiBodyConsume from within the rebuild function to specify whether
the original edit body is appended (default) or replaced with multiple bodies in
the FeatureManager design tree's Solid Bodies folder. |
| Create | Creates one or more output bodies | Obtains the IMacroFeatureData object from the
input Feature object Obtains the selections and parameters from the
IMacroFeatureData object Processes the inputs according to the design of
the feature Copies any new selected object Creates any new geometry based on the input data Creates the new bodies Calls IMacroFeatureData::GetEntitiesNeedUserId on the new body Gets any faces or edges
that need IDs Places IDs using IMacroFeatureData::SetFaceUserId and IMacroFeatureData::SetEdgeUserId ,
respectively NOTE : The numbering
scheme should be consistent and reproducible. Return values can be: IBody2 ,
the newly created body, or a VARIANT SafeArray containign multiple IBody2
objects False, which indicates
failure and provides no additional information String, which is displayed
in an error message to the user; for example: VBA swmRebuild = "Macro
feature output error message" C++ COM CComBSTR bMsg = _T("Macro feature output error message"); _variant_t vBSTRRet = bMsg; *retval = vBSTRRet; C# functionReturnValue =
"Macro feature output error message"; return functionReturnValue; VB.NET Regenerate = "Macro feature output error message" NOTE: A macro feature rebuild function can
output more than one body, in a VARIANT SafeArray containing multiple IBody2
objects, by either modifying one or more edit bodies or by creating one or more
new bodies. For multibody macro features only, call IMacroFeatureData::EnableMultiBodyConsume from within the rebuild function to specify whether
the original edit body is appended (default) or replaced with multiple bodies in
the FeatureManager design tree's Solid Bodies folder. |

The rebuild function is called by SOLIDWORKS whenever the macro feature
is regenerated. The parametric information needed to regenerate the feature
should be stored in the feature’s parameter and selection lists. These
lists are created when the feature is inserted into the model and are
available for reading and editing from the feature’s IMacroFeatureData
interface. For example, the data stored in the parameters and selection
lists can be used to perform low-level Boolean body operations to affect
geometric features.

Because IBody2 objects created using the API do not always automatically
assign IDs to their faces and edges, you should always check that there
are no entity IDs that need to be assigned. Otherwise, any Boolean body
operations involving that Body2 object will cause regeneration to fail.
Use IMacroFeatureData::GetEntitiesNeedUserIdkadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}to
check for the IDs. If the faces and edges arrays returned are both empty,
then no user IDs are required. Otherwise, use IMacroFeatureData::SetFaceUserId
and IMacroFeatureData::SetEdgeUserId to set the IDs of those entities.

The macro feature’s rebuild function is responsible for ensuring that
the same IDs are always placed on the same entities each time the regeneration
function is called. The order in which the entities are returned cannot
be used. Instead, there should be some algorithm used that relies on the
geometry of the body to determine entity IDs. Of course, features with
no impact on the geometry of the model can also be created.

The following example illustrates a VBA-based rebuild function. When
called, it returns true to indicate to SOLIDWORKS that it was successful.

Function swmRegen(app As Variant, part As
Variant, feature As Variant) As Variant

msgbox "Regeneration function called."kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}

.

.

.

swmRegen = True

End Function

NOTES:

- When regenerating a macro
  feature,

  [IDimension::ReferencePoints](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IDimension~ReferencePoints.html)

  gets and sets the reference points of a display dimension (

  [IDisplayDimension](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IDisplayDimension.html)

  object).

  kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}

  kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}

  In
  all other cases, this property gets and sets the reference points of a
  dimension (

  [IDimension](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IDimension.html)

  object).
- ```
  If your macro feature is crashing while regenerating, then force garbage collection and wait for all finalizers to complete before continuing. For example, include the following code at the end of your rebuild function in a VB.NET application:
  ```

  ‘Wait for all finalizers to complete before continuing

  GC.Collect() GC.WaitforPendingFinalizers() GC.Collect() GC.WaitforPendingFinalizers()
