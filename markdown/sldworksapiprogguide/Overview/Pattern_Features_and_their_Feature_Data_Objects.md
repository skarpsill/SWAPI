# Pattern Features and their Feature Data Objects

#### To create a pattern feature:

1. Open a part (or an assembly for a local pattern).
2. Pre-selection of entities may be supported for some pattern features.
  Refer to the remarks and
  examples in the pattern-specific feature data interfaces.

  | To create an instance of... | Call IFeatureManager::CreateDefinition ( swFeatureNameID_e ...) |
  | --- | --- |
  | IChainPatternFeatureData | swFmLocalChainPattern |
  | ICircularPatternFeatureData | swFmCirPattern |
  | ILocalCircularPatternFeatureData | swFmLocalCirPattern |
  | ICurveDrivenPatternFeatureData | swFmCurvePattern |
  | ILocalCurvePatternFeatureData | swFmLocalCurvePattern |
  | IDerivedPatternFeatureData | swFmDerivedLPattern |
  | IDimPatternFeatureData | swFmDimPattern |
  | IFillPatternFeatureData | swFmFillPattern |
  | ILinearPatternFeatureData | swFmLPattern |
  | ILocalLinearPatternFeatureData | swFmLocalLPattern |
  | ISketchPatternFeatureData | swFmSketchPattern |
  | ILocalSketchPatternFeatureData | swFmLocalSketchPattern |
  | ITablePatternFeatureData | swFmTablePattern |
3. Modify properties on the pattern-specific feature data object.
4. Create the pattern-specific feature by calling[IFeatureManager::CreateFeature](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~CreateFeature.html).

**To edit a pattern feature:**

1. Call

  [IFeature::GetDefinition](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetDefinition.html)

  to get the pattern-specific feature data object.
2. Call AccessSelections on the pattern-specific feature data
  object.
3. Modify properties on the pattern-specific feature data object.
4. Call

  [IFeature::ModifyDefinition](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html)

  if you modified the
  feature or
  ReleaseSelectionAccess on the pattern-specific feature data object if you did not modify
  the feature.
