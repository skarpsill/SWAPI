# Quick Tips and Bubble ToolTips

Typically an add-in's Quick Tips tells a user how to
use the add-in application from start to finish. Creating Quick Tips and
Bubble ToolTips for an add-in requires:

- [Add-in application](#Add-in)to create
  a copy of the Quick Tips interface
- [Each HTML page of the add-in's
  Quick Tips](#HTML)to create a copy of Quick Tips HTML object

### Add-in application

1. Implements a copy of the Quick Tips interface,[ISwQuickTip](swpublishedAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.swpublished~SolidWorks.interop.swpublished.ISwQuickTip.html),
  which defines the add-in's Quick Tips environment.
2. Creates a copy of the Quick Tips interface using[ISldWorks::InstallQuickTipGuide](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~InstallQuickTipGuide.html)When an add-in application implements a copy of the Quick Tips interface,
  the SOLIDWORKS application adds a selection to its SOLIDWORKS Help menu
  indicating the existence of that add-in's Quick Tips.

By default, the SOLIDWORKS Quick Tips is
the active Quick Tips. When a user selects an add-in's Quick Tips on the
SOLIDWORKS Help menu, that add-in's Quick Tips becomes active and the
SOLIDWORKS Quick Tips becomes inactive. If a user clicks the Quick Tips
button on the SOLIDWORKS status bar, the SOLIDWORKS Quick Tips becomes
active and any active add-in's Quick Tips becomes inactive. Only one application's
Quick Tips can be active at any one time.

Because an add-in does not know whether or
not its Quick Tips window is active, the add-in should assume that it
is active. The state of the add-in application determines which HTML page
of its Quick Tips is displayed.

1. Calls[ISwQuickTip::AppState](swpublishedAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.swpublished~SolidWorks.interop.swpublished.ISwQuickTip~AppState.html)to tell the Quick Tips interface that the state of the add-in application
  has changed. Examples of SOLIDWORKS states are:
2. Calls[ISldWorks::RefreshQuickTipWindow](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~RefreshQuickTipWindow.html),
  which causes the SOLIDWORKS application to request a new URL to display
  in the Quick Tips window. The new URL is then returned to the SOLIDWORKS
  application and displayed in the Quick Tips window.
3. When the add-in application
  is closing, calls[ISldWorks:: UnInstallQuickTipGuide](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~UnInstallQuickTipGuide.html)tokadov_tag{{<ignored>}}uninstallkadov_tag{{</ignored>}}the add-in's Quick Tips.

### Each Quick Tips HTML page

1. Must specify the correct background color of the
  Quick Tips HTML page as follows:

<style>

body

kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}{

kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}background-color:
#ffffe1;

kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}}

</style>

1. Creates a copy of ISwHtmlInterface, which defines
  the add-in's Quick Tips environment for that HTML page.
2. Calls[ISwHtmlInterface::ShowBubbleToolTipAt](swhtmlcontrolAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.Interop.swhtmlcontrol~SolidWorks.Interop.swhtmlcontrol.ISwHtmlInterface~ShowBubbleTooltipAt.html)or[ISwHtmlInterface::ShowBubbleTooltip](swhtmlcontrolAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.Interop.swhtmlcontrol~SolidWorks.Interop.swhtmlcontrol.ISwHtmlInterface~ShowBubbleTooltip.html),
  which displays a Bubble ToolTip and causes a toolbar or toolbar buttons
  to flash, when a user clicks a link on the Quick Tips HTML page.
