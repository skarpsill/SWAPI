# SOLIDWORKS Connected

As of SOLIDWORKS 2020 SP03.1, SOLIDWORKS can run on the**3D**EXPERIENCE
platform as SOLIDWORKS Connected. SOLIDWORKS Connected provides access to all
the**3D**EXPERIENCE services and apps that you are entitled to use
based on your role. Before using the SOLIDWORKS APIs with SOLIDWORKS Connected,
you must install and set up roles and collaborative spaces in the**3D**EXPERIENCE
platform and install SOLIDWORKS Connected.

Read**SOLIDWORKS Connected Help > Installation**.

#### Using SOLIDWORKS APIs with SOLIDWORKS
Connected

As with SOLIDWORKS Desktop, you can use the
Macro toolbar in SOLIDWORKS Connected to create and edit macros. Macros are
saved in the local directories that you specify. You can make references to type
libraries and interop assemblies in the local SOLIDWORKS installation that
SOLIDWORKS Connected deploys. You can also presume that most of your working
SOLIDWORKS macros will also work with SOLIDWORKS Connected. However due**3D**EXPERIENCE file storage, some SOLIDWORKS APIs have been added,
changed, or discontinued for use with SOLIDWORKS Connected.

Note the following:

- SOLIDWORKS Connected opens**3D**EXPERIENCE
  documents with limited options. See the[ISldWorks::OpenDoc7](sldworksapi.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~OpenDoc7.html)and[IDocumentSpecification](sldworksapi.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IDocumentSpecification.html)Remarks.

  - Open a part in one of two modes:
    Resolved or Quick View.
  - Open an assembly in one of three modes:
    Large Design Review, LightWeight, or Resolved. You can also opt to use
    Speedpak and load hidden components.
  - Open a drawing in one of four modes:
    Quick View, Detailing, LightWeight, or Resolved. You can also opt to use
    Speedpak.
  - See IDocumentSpecification::Selective,
    IDocumentSpecification::LightWeight,
    IDocumentSpecification::UseLightWeightDefault,
    IDocumentSpecification::ViewOnly, IDocumentSpecification::DetailingMode,
    IDocumentSpecification::UseSpeedPak, and
    IDocumentSpecification::IgnoreHiddenComponents.
- Documents opened with SOLIDWORKS Connected
  can be saved only to a**3D**EXPERIENCE collaborative space
  that you previously set up. Documents cannot be saved locally and, once
  saved to the**3D**EXPERIENCE platform with SOLIDWORKS
  Connected, cannot be retrieved from outside of the**3D**EXPERIENCE
  platform.
- Documents that have been saved with either
  SOLIDWORKS Desktop or SOLIDWORKS Connected can be opened with SOLIDWORKS
  Connected. However, documents saved with SOLIDWORKS Connected can only be
  opened from within the**3D**EXPERIENCE platform or with
  SOLIDWORKS Connected.
- SOLIDWORKS Connected employs the Product
  Lifecycle Management (PLM) software provided by**3D**EXPERIENCE.
  Therefore, the SOLIDWORKS PDM Pro API does not work with SOLDWORKS
  Connected.

APIs that support opening and saving documents
with SOLIDWORKS Connected are available as of SOLIDWORKS 2020 SP03.1. In future
releases, more APIs specific to SOLIDWORKS Connected functionality may be added.
You should always read the API Help Release Notes in each service pack to learn
about API changes for SOLIDWORKS Connected functionality. Use the Index and
Search tabs in the SOLIDWORKS API Help to search for "3DEXPERIENCE" or
"SOLIDWORKS Connected".

After you install SOLIDWORKS Connected, run the
following two examples in order:

#### Example 1: Save a SOLIDWORKS Connected
document

' VBA

' Preconditions: Open a new part with SOLIDWORKS Connected.

' Postconditions:

' 1.**NonActiveSave.sldprt**is saved to a collaborative space
on the**3D**EXPERIENCE platform.

' 2. Use**3D**EXPERIENCE**3D**Search to find**NonActiveSave.sldprt**on the**3D**EXPERIENCE
platform.

' 3. Do not close the document as Example 2 requires that it be open.

Option Explicit
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks
Dim swModel As
SldWorks.ModelDoc2
Dim swModExt As SldWorks.ModelDocExtension
Dim
swSaveTo3DExp As SldWorks.SaveTo3DExperienceOptions
Dim strFileName,
strComment As String
Dim bStat As Boolean
Dim lError As Long
Dim
IWarning As Long

Sub main()

Set swApp =
Application.SldWorks
Set swModel = swApp.**ActiveDoc**
Set swModExt = swModel.**Extension**

If swApp.**ApplicationType**=
swApplicationType_3DEXPERIENCE Then

Set swSaveTo3DExp
= swApp.**GetSaveTo3DExperienceOptions**

strFileName = "NonActiveSave.sldprt"
strComment = "No comment"
swSaveTo3DExp.**FileName**= strFileName
bStat = swSaveTo3DExp.**SetRevisionComments**(strComment)

bStat = swModExt.**SaveTo3DExperience**(swSaveTo3DExp, lError,
IWarning)

End If

End Sub

#### Example 2: Open a SOLIDWORKS Connected document

' VBA

' Preconditions:
' 1.**NonActiveSave.sldprt**is open in
SOLIDWORKS Connected.
' 2. Open the Immediate window.
' 3. Run the macro.
' 4. When the macro stops, close the document.
' 5. Press F5 to reopen the**3D**EXPERIENCE document.

' Postconditions:**NonActiveSave.sldprt**is re-opened from the**3D**EXPERIENCE platform.

Option Explicit
Dim swApp As
SldWorks.SldWorks
Dim swModel As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
Dim swModExt As
SldWorks.ModelDocExtension
Dim swPart As SldWorks.PartDoc
Dim
swPLMObjectSpecification As SldWorks.PLMObjectSpecification
Dim
swDocSpecification As SldWorks.DocumentSpecification
Dim strPartTitle As
String
Dim strPLMid As String

Sub main()

Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
Set swModel =
swApp.**ActiveDoc**
Set swModExt =
swModel.**Extension**

If swApp.**ApplicationType**= swApplicationType_3DEXPERIENCE Then

strPLMid = swModExt.**GetPLMID**
Debug.Print swModel.**GetPathName**& " " & strPLMid

Stop 'Close document in the user interface

'Open**3D**EXPERIENCE document using the API

Set swDocSpecification = swApp.**GetOpenDocSpec**("")
Set swPLMObjectSpecification = swDocSpecification.**PLMObjectSpecification**
swPLMObjectSpecification.**PLMID**= strPLMid

Set swModel = swApp.**OpenDoc7**(swDocSpecification)

End If

End Sub

Also see the[IPLMObjectSpecification](sldworksapi.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IPLMObjectSpecification.html).NET examples.
