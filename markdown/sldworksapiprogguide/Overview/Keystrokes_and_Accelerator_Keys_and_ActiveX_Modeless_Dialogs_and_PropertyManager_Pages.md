# Keystrokes and Accelerator Keys in ActiveX Modeless Dialogs and Property Manager Pages

## Keystrokes and Accelerator Keys in ActiveX Modeless Dialogs and PropertyManager
Pages

### Problem

The following VB.NET code displays a modeless dialog, but the Tab and
Enter keys are not captured by SOLIDWORKS.

Public Sub OnSampleCallback()

kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}Dim
myForm As New Form1()

kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}myForm.Show()

End Sub

You could add event handlers to capture the missing keystrokes, but
the dialog will still not behave as intended. Therefore, try using the
followingkadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}code.

### Solution

To display a modeless dialog that captures Tab and Enter keys from a
VB.NET add-in, you could code the add-in's menu callback code as follows:

Public Sub OnSampleCallback()

kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}Dim
myForm As New Form1()

kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}Application.Run(myForm)

End Sub

By callingApplication.Run,
you create a new application message loop for the dialog, which is separate
from the SOLIDWORKS message loop. The dialog remains a child process to
SOLIDWORKS, and the events are handled as expected. This solution also
applies to C#.

However, because an add-in runs in the same process as SOLIDWORKS, the
SOLIDWORKS message loop will get usurped by the one your add-in just started.
If that is a problem, then another solution is to add hooks to the SOLIDWORKS
message loop for the modeless dialog or PropertyManager page instead of
replacing the SOLIDWORKS message loop with one of your own. The following
examples show how to do this.
