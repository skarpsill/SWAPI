# Inspecting the SOLIDWORKS VB.NET Add-In Template

## Inspecting the SOLIDWORKS VB.NET Add-in Template

This topic identifies and describes
the classes provided by the[SOLIDWORKS VB.NET add-in template](SolidWorks_CSharp_and_VB.NET__Project_Templates.htm).

### Examining Visual Basic .NET Add-In Classes

Inspect the add-in in Visual Studio's Solution Explorer. These classes are
copied to the add-in from theSOLIDWORKS
VB.NET Add-in Template:

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| AssemblyInfo.vb | This file provides a means to organize and publish assembly-specific
information. |
| EventHandling.vb | This file contains the event handling objects for
documents and model views. The DocumentEventHandler object is a base
class that exposes the interface and contains code for dealing with
ModelView events. PartEventHandler, AssemblyEventHandler, and DrawingEventHandler are
the three object types that can listen for document events. There
must be one instance of each class for each open document of that
type. The ModelViewEventHandler object listens for ModelView events.
There should be one instance of ModelViewEventHandler for each
ModelView in each open document. |
| PMPHandler.vb | This file contains the class that implements the
PropertyManager page handler interface. An instance of this object
is passed to SOLIDWORKS when creating a PropertyManager page. When a
control on the page is manipulated, the corresponding function or
subroutine in
this object is called. |
| SwAddin n .vb | This file contains the main add-in class. Visual Studio
adds the letter n to the default name SwAddin, if more than one project
by that name exists in the same
location. Examine the code in
each region of this file: Region Description Local Variables Contains the definitions of this class's
variables SOLIDWORKS Registration Contains functions to register and unregister the
add-in ISwAddin Implementation Contains ConnectToSW() and DisconnectFromSW() which
are the entry and exit points for the add-in UI Methods Contains functions and subroutines that define how
the add-in behaves within the SOLIDWORKS
application Event Methods Contains SOLIDWORKS event handling functions and
subroutines Event Handlers Contains the event callbacks for the SOLIDWORKS
object UI Callbacks Contains functions and subroutines that are called
from the add-in user interface |
| Region | Description |
| Local Variables | Contains the definitions of this class's
variables |
| SOLIDWORKS Registration | Contains functions to register and unregister the
add-in |
| ISwAddin Implementation | Contains ConnectToSW() and DisconnectFromSW() which
are the entry and exit points for the add-in |
| UI Methods | Contains functions and subroutines that define how
the add-in behaves within the SOLIDWORKS
application |
| Event Methods | Contains SOLIDWORKS event handling functions and
subroutines |
| Event Handlers | Contains the event callbacks for the SOLIDWORKS
object |
| UI Callbacks | Contains functions and subroutines that are called
from the add-in user interface |
| UserPMPage.vb | This file contains the wrapper class and layout methods
for the add-in's PropertyManager page. To modify the controls on the
PropertyManager page, change the code in the AddControls()
subroutine. Add all controls to group boxes. Group boxes are displayed top to
bottom in the order in which they are added to the page. Controls
are displayed top to bottom in the order in which they are added to
the group box. |
