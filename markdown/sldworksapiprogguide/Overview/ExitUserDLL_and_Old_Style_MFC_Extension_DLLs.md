# ExitUserDLL and Old Style MFC Extension DLLs

In SOLIDWORKS 2006 and later, the return value of the exported function ExitUserDLL() is checked to see if an add-in allows or disallows unloading
by SOLIDWORKS. The return value is of type[BOOL](BOOL_and_VARIANT_BOOL_Are_Different_Types.htm),
where:

- TRUE means the add-in can safely be unloaded by
  SOLIDWORKS.
- FALSE means the add-in
  should not be unloaded by SOLIDWORKS.

Add-ins should typically disallow unloading when there are pending references
on automation objects managed by the add-in. Continuing the unload process
will typically crash SOLIDWORKS if an attempt to free these objects occurs
after the add-in has been unloaded.
