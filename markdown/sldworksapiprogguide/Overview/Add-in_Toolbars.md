# Add-in Toolbars

The first time a SOLIDWORKS add-in runs, its toolbars are instantiated, which means that the add-in acquires
a toolbar ID for each of its toolbars and their buttons. Toolbar IDs are
stored in the registry.

To change an add-in toolbar during development, you can clear the registry
before changing the toolbar. However, for the release version of the add-in,
assign a new toolbar ID to each new add-in toolbar so that it becomes
a new toolbar in the CommandGroup. Users who run different versions of
the add-in and SOLIDWORKS can then use the appropriate version of the
add-in toolbar, because activating an add-in toolbar won't collide with
a different version of SOLIDWORKS.
