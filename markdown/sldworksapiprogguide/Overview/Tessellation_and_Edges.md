# Tessellation and Edges

A couple of approaches are available for finding tessellations for edges.

- Get the range of the curve and tessellate the
  curve along that range.

or -

- Use[IFace2::GetTessTriStripEdges](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IFace2~GetTessTriStripEdges.html)to get the indices into the tessellation that represents the edges of
  the face.

The first approach gives you better control over the edge. The second
approach gives you a tight boundary if you are rendering edges and faces
at the same time.
