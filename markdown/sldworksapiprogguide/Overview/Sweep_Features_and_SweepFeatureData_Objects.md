# Sweep Features and SweepFeatureData Objects

#### To create a Sweep feature:

- See the[ISweepFeatureData](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.ISweepFeatureData.html)examples.
- Open a part in SOLIDWORKS and create a profile and a path along which to
  sweep the profile. Create guide curves, if using a sketch profile.
- In a macro:

  - Access the part.
  - Call

    [IModelDocExtension::SelectByRay](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~SelectByRay.html)

    to select the:

    1. Profile

      :

      - If a sketch profile, use Mark = 1 to select a face, edge, or curve. For a swept-boss
        feature, the sketch profile must be closed. For a swept-surface feature,
        the sketch profile is open or closed.
      - If a circular profile, use Mark = 4 to select a sketch line, edge or curve. The
        circular profile is open or closed.
      - If a solid profile, use Mark = 1 to select the tool body to use to
        make the cut and use Mark = 2048 to select the solid body to cut.
        Solid profiles are used only in swept-cut features.
    2. Sweep path

      using Mark = 4:

      - Select a set of
        sketched curves contained in one sketch, a curve, or a set of model
        edges.
      - The sweep path is open or closed.
      - The starting point of the sweep path must lie on the plane of the
        profile for a 1-directional sweep. If the sweep path extends to both
        sides of the profile, you can create a bidirectional sweep.
      - Sweep paths are not used with circular profiles.
    3. Guide curves

      using Mark = 2:

      - Guide curves are used only with sketch profiles.
      - A guide curve must be coincident with
        the sketch profile or with a point on the profile sketch.
      - Guide curves are not used in bidirectional sweeps.
    4. Direction vector

      using Mark = 128:

      - Select a plane, face, line, axis, edge, cylinder, or a pair of
        vertices that define the direction.
  - To create a SweepFeatureData object and initialize it with default
    properties for a:
- If you specified a direction vector in step 3.2.4 above, then before
  creating the sweep feature you must:

  - Set

    [ISweepFeatureData::PathAlignmentType](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.ISweepFeatureData~PathAlignmentType.html)

    to

    [swTangencyType_e](swconst.chm::/SolidWorks.Interop.swconst~SolidWorks.Interop.swconst.swTangencyType_e.html)

    .swTangencyDirectionVector.
  - Set

    [ISweepFeatureData::TwistControlType](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.ISweepFeatureData~TwistControlType.html)

    to

    [swTwistControlType_e](swconst.chm::/SolidWorks.Interop.swconst~SolidWorks.Interop.swconst.swTwistControlType_e.html)

    .swTwistControlFollowPath.
- Before creating a thin-walled swept-cut or swept-boss feature, you must:

  - Set

    [ISweepFeatureData::ThinFeature](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.ISweepFeatureData~ThinFeature.html)

    to true.
  - Set

    [ISweepFeatureData::ThinWallType](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.ISweepFeatureData~ThinWallType.html)

    .
  - Call

    [ISweepFeatureData::SetWallThickness](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.ISweepFeatureData~SetWallThickness.html)

    .
- Modify other ISweepFeatureData properties that apply to the
  selected profile. For example for a sketch profile, if the sweep path
  extends to both sides of the profile, you can make the sweep bidirectional
  by setting

  [ISweepFeatureData::Direction](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.ISweepFeatureData~Direction.html)

  .
  See the SOLIDWORKS help and

  [ISweepFeatureData](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.ISweepFeatureData.html)

  for more information about sweep feature properties.
- Create the sweep feature by calling

  [IFeatureManager::CreateFeature](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~CreateFeature.html)

  (SweepFeatureData
  object).

#### To edit the Sweep feature:

1. Call

  [IFeature::GetDefinition](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetDefinition.html)

  to access the SweepFeatureData object.
2. Call

  [ISweepFeatureData:: AccessSelections](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.ISweepFeatureData~AccessSelections.html)

  .
3. Modify ISweepFeatureData object properties. Note that you
  cannot create a thin-walled sweep feature at this point.
4. Call

  [IFeature::ModifyDefinition](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html)

  , if you modified the
  feature, or

  [ISweepFeatureData::ReleaseSelectionAccess](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.ISweepFeatureData~ReleaseSelectionAccess.html)

  , if you did not modify
  the feature.
