# Monitor Loading of .NET Interop Assemblies

You can monitor which .NET interop assemblies are loaded by the .NET
runtime.

The subsystem of the .NET runtime that handles resolving, loading, and
binding to assemblies is called Fusion and includes a log viewer. Invoke the log
viewer in your version of Microsoft .NET framework as follows:

| If you have Microsoft .NET Framework Version... | Run... |
| --- | --- |
| 2.0 or 3.5 | Fuslogvw.exe in Start Menu > All Programs
> Microsoft .NET Framework SDK v2.0 > SDK Command Prompt |
| 4.0 | Fuslogvw.exe in Start Menu > All Programs
> Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 > Visual Studio Tools > Visual Studio
Command Prompt |

The log viewer allows you to monitor which interop assemblies .NET is looking
for and which ones it actually finds and loads. This includes the .NET
primary interop assemblies needed by a SOLIDWORKS, SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional, etc.

This tool is helpful in determining why .NET did not find a particular
assembly or found the wrong one.
