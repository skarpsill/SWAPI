# Presentation Transforms

The[IComponent2::PresentationTransform](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IComponent2~PresentationTransform.html)property changes the displayed portion of assembly components without
affecting the position of the underlying model geometry. This API:

- Gets or sets the component transform for graphical
  display.
- Ignores all mate and in-context relationships.
  Only the display of the component on the screen is affected.
- Does not apply the transform to component geometry.
- Does not display any changes. To display changes,
  call[IModelDoc2::GraphicsRedraw2](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~GraphicsRedraw2.html).

This property's functionality is for graphical purposes only and does
not affect solid models. For example, if you want to animate the explode
steps for an assembly, then maintaining assembly mate and in-context relationships
is not needed or desirable.

Before setting a presentation transform, you must set[IAssemblyDoc::EnablePresentation](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IAssemblyDoc~EnablePresentation.html)to true. IAssemblyDoc::EnablePresentation must then be set to false after
a user is finished with presentation transforms and has called[IComponent2::RemovePresentationTransform](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IComponent2~RemovePresentationTransform.html),
which removes any transform applied by IComponent2::PresentationTransform.
After calling this method, the component is next drawn in a position consistent
with its underlying geometry ([IComponent2::Transform2](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IComponent2~Transform2.html)).

The preferred way to change the position of an assembly component is
to use the[IDragOperator](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IDragOperator.html)object. This object allows access to the settings for theMove
Componentcommand in the SOLIDWORKS user interface. Components
moved with this API honor all assembly mate and in-context relationships.kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}When done
moving a component ([IDragOperator::EndDrag](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IDragOperator~EndDrag.html)),
you might have to call[IModelDoc2::EditRebuild3](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~EditRebuild3.html)to update any model geometry.
