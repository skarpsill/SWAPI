# VBA Macros, Type Libraries, and SOLIDWORKS Upgrade

When upgrading to a newer version of SOLIDWORKS, an existing VBA macro
might fail on this line of code:

Set swApp = Application.SldWorks

with this message:

Compile error:

Object library feature not supported

#### To resolve compile error:

1. ClickTools,
  Referencesin the IDE.
2. Select the SOLIDWORKS type libraries referenced
  by the VBA macro.
3. Use the up- and down-arrow buttons to change the
  priority of the selected SOLIDWORKS type libraries.
4. ClickOK.

The type libraries should be reread by VBA. However, if the previous
procedure fails:

1. ClickTools,
  Referencesagain.
2. Select a type library that is not used in the
  macro.
3. ClickOK.

The type libraries should be reread by VBA. Once the macro runs, you
can deselect the type library just selected.
