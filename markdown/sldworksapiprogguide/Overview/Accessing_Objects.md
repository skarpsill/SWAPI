# Accessing SOLIDWORKS Objects

To call any of the SOLIDWORKS API's methods
or properties, you first need to obtain the object. For example, to use
the IFace2::GetArea method you need to have a IFace2 object.

There are various ways to access objects within
the SOLIDWORKS API. To obtain the Face2 object, you could use one of the
following accessors:

- Obtain the IBody2
  object using IPartDoc::GetBodies2 or IPartDoc::EnumBodies3, and then traverse
  the faces on the body using the IBody2::GetFirstFace and IFace2::GetNextFace
  methods.

  - or -
- Get the IFace2 object
  from the current set of selected items using ISelectionMgr::GetSelectedObject6.

  - or -
- Get the IFace2 object
  by its name using IPartDoc::GetEntityByName.

When you have the IFace2 object, you can access
the properties and methods found in the Face2 class. For example, you
could get the number of edges on the face using the IFace2::GetEdgeCount
method, or you could get the normal vector for the face using the IFace2::Normal
property.

NOTE:Some methods and properties, such as IFeatureManager::InsertMateReference,
also require one or more selected items. The items can be selected in
one of two ways:

- The end-user can
  interactively select the items.

  - or -
- You can programmatically
  select the items using IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2.
