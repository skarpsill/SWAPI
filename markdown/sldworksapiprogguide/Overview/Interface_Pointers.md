# Interface Pointers

Interface pointers can be an area of confusion with unmanaged C++ programming.
Each SOLIDWORKS API method that returns an interface pointer automatically
increments the reference count on the interface pointer by 1.

- COM implementations.
  You can call a SOLIDWORKS API that returns an interface pointer. You can
  then use this pointer as you like, but you are responsible for releasing
  it.

This unmanaged C++ COM example demonstrates
how to handle interface pointers.

{

LPMODELDOC2 m_ModelDoc
= NULL;

// Get the IModelDoc pointer

HRESULT res = UserApp->getSWApp()->get_IActiveDoc(
&m_ModelDoc );

if( m_ModelDoc ==
NULL )

return;

LPPARTDOC m_PartDoc
= NULL;

// Get the IPartDoc pointer

res = m_ModelDoc->QueryInterface(IID_IPartDoc,
(LPVOID *)&m_PartDoc);

ASSERT( res == S_OK
);

.

.

// Use the interface pointers within your
code and then release them when done

.

.

m_ModelDoc->Release();//
Release the IModelDoc2 pointer

m_PartDoc->Release();//
Release the IPartDoc pointer

}

NOTE:LPINTERFACEis atypedefand a pointer
to the named interface. e.g.,LPPARTDOCpoints to the PartDoc interface,LPMODELDOC2points to the ModelDoc2 interface, etc.

You can also use[smart pointers](Smart_Pointers.htm)with COM implementations.CComPtris an ATL smart pointer.IInterfacePtr(e.g.,IModelDoc2Ptr)
is also a smart pointer that does many of the same things asCComPtr,
but it is not part of ATL. It is atypedefthat resolves to a_com_ptr_tkadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}(defined
incomip.h) usingkadov_tag{{<spaces>}}_COM_SMARTPTR_TYPEDEF.
For more information about using smart pointers with container classes, see[STL Container Classes and Smart Pointers](STL_Container_Classes_and_Smart_Pointers.htm).

For an example of using smart pointers, see[Access
Assembly Example (C++ COM)](sldworksAPI.chm::/Access_Assembly_Example_CPlusPlus_COM.htm).

- Dispatch implementations.
  The release of the interface pointer is hidden in the destructor of the
  Dispatch objects (for example, IModelDoc2, IFace2, and so on). This implies
  that attaching an interface pointer to more than one of these Dispatch
  objects will cause a release to be performed by each of the objects as
  they go out of scope. This will cause a problem because the reference
  count was only incremented once when the interface pointer was returned
  to you.

To avoid this problem, you must manually
increment the reference count (pdisp->AddRef();) if you are attaching the interface
pointer to more than one object.

This C++ Dispatch example demonstrates how
to handle the reference count on interface pointers.

{

LPDISPATCH modDisp;

// Get interface
pointer to the active document

modDisp = UserApp->getSWApp()->GetActiveDoc();

// Reference count on modDisp automatically
incremented by 1

if( modDisp
== NULL )

return;

// Attach to the IModelDoc2 object

IModelDoc2 m_ModelDoc(
modDisp );

// Attach to the IPartDoc object

IPartDoc m_PartDoc(
modDisp );

// Manually
increment the reference count on modDispbecause

// you use modDisp
a second time

modDisp->AddRef();

.

.

// Use objects within your code

.

.

// Variables go out of scope and destructors are
called for IModelDoc2 and IPartDoc,

// which decrements the reference count
on modDisp by two

}
