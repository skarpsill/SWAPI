# Instantiate ActiveX Controls as Tabs

Adding a custom tab to the FeatureManager design tree and model view
were previously only available to MFC-extension DLL add-ins and required
a strong knowledge of MFC, Windows messaging, and Windows SDK. Problems
were difficult to diagnose and fix. Additionally the SOLIDWORKS methods
for adding a tab to the FeatureManager design tree and model view were
highly MFC-specific and, as such, were not COM-compliant.

SOLIDWORKS now has the ability to instantiate any arbitrary ActiveX
control as a tab in the FeatureManager design tree and model view. The
new methods are fully COM-compliant and reduce the knowledge required
for adding a tab.

Using VBA, VB.NET, C#, or any development environment capable of creating
an ActiveX control, you can easily develop a SOLIDWORKS-specific ActiveX
control.
