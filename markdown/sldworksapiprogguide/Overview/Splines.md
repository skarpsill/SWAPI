# Splines

Some common questions and answers about SOLIDWORKS and splines are
presented in this help topic.

**What are the different types of splines used in SOLIDWORKS?**

Any curve in SOLIDWORKS that is not an analytic curve, such as a line, arc,
conic, or a composite curve, is represented as a b-spline. SOLIDWORKS uses
standard b-splines as defined in computer-aided design
literature.

**What are the mathematical names for b-spline and p-spline? What is
the difference between ICurve::GetPCurveParams2 and ICurve::GetBCurveParams5? Do these methods return parameters for two different kinds of splines, or do
they return parameters formatted in two different ways for a single spline type?**

Names such as p-spline, or p-curve, are used for b-splines in a particular
context. If you are unsure of the context, then you might find the names
confusing. For example, p-curves, as in[IModeler::CreatePCurve](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IModeler~CreatePCurve.html), are b-splines
that lie on a surface and are created from b-splines in the parameter space of
the surface.

Any b-spline is a piecewise polynomial curve, and a p-spline is a b-spline
represented as the polynomial coefficients that define the polynomials in each
segment of the b-spline.

- ICurve::GetBCurveParams5 gets
  the control point/knot standard b-spline representation for the input curve.
- ICurve::GetPCurveParams gets the polynomial coefficients for the segments of a b-spline for the
  input curve.
- ICurve::GetPCurveParams2 is a hybrid of ICurve::GetBCurveParams5 and ICurve::GetPCurveParms. You
  can use either the control point/knot representation, which it returns in
  the SplineParamData object , or the polynomial coefficient representation for
  the individual segments.

**When can you edit the control points of a b-spline?**

You can edit control points
when creating a b-spline; however, you currently cannot replace control points
of an existing b-spline.

**What kind of spline is returned by
ISketchManager::CreateSpline2, IModelDoc2::SketchSpline, and IFeatureManager::MakeStyledCurves2?**

All three
methods create b-splines.

- [ISketchManager::CreateSpline2](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.ISketchManager~CreateSpline2.html)creates a b-spline using the input points as
  through points, or interpolation points, with some control over the curve’s
  end conditions.
- [IModelDoc2::SketchSpline](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~SketchSpline.html)is an attempt to simulate the way you create a b-spline
  in the SOLIDWORKS user interface, one point at a time.
- [IFeatureManager::MakeStyledCurves2](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~MakeStyledCurves2.html)fits a b-spline that approximates a
  composite curve of sketch segments.

**What b-spline points for the curve does ICurve::GetSplinePts return?**

[ICurve::GetSplinePts](sldworksAPI.chm::/SolidWorks.interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.interop.sldworks.ICurve~GetSplinePts.html)gets a spline's through/interpolation points, i.e., the end
points of its individual spline segments, as opposed to its representation by
knots and control points.
