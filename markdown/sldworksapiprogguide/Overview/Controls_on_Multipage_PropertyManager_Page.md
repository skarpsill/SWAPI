# Controls on Multipage PropertyManager Page

All of the controls for a multipage PropertyManager page must be contained
on a single page.

Your add-in must simulate the appearance of multipage controls by showing
and hiding the appropriate controls (the add-in must know which controls
to show on each page) as the user moves from page to page. This means
that your implementation of[IPropertyManagerPage2Handler8](swpublishedapi.chm::/SolidWorks.Interop.swpublished~SolidWorks.Interop.swpublished.IPropertyManagerPage2Handler8.html)must know which page is currently in use and act accordingly within the[IPropertyManagerPage2Handler8::OnNextPage](swpublishedapi.chm::/SolidWorks.Interop.swpublished~SolidWorks.Interop.swpublished.IPropertyManagerPage2Handler8~OnNextPage.html)and[IPropertyManagerPage2Handler8::OnPreviousPage](swpublishedapi.chm::/SolidWorks.Interop.swpublished~SolidWorks.Interop.swpublished.IPropertyManagerPage2Handler8~OnPreviousPage.html)callbacks.

Your add-in must not respond to the next page handler by trying to show
a second page because:

- The first page will close.
- When the next page handler returns control to
  the SOLIDWORKS application and your code, the first page is gone and a
  memory error occurs.
