## VBA Syntax

See

[PropertyManagerPage2Handler7::OnSelectionboxListChanged](ms-its:swpublishedapivb6.chm::/swpublished~PropertyManagerPage2Handler7~OnSelectionboxListChanged.html)

.

## Remarks

This method is called when your application uses a selection method, such as[IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2](ms-its:sldworksapi.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~SelectByID2.html), just as if the selection was made interactively.

The method is called during the process of SOLIDWORKS selection. It is neither a pre-notification nor a post-notification. The add-in should not be taking any action that may affect the model or the selection list. The add-in should only be querying information, presumably about the state of selections to set up its own information correctly.

Regardless of how many items the user selects, this method is called only once per interactive box selection. In other words, if the user selects six faces using a box selection, this method is called only once.
