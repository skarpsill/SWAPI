## Remarks

This handler method is called when the PropertyManager page is about to close.kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}

SOLIDWORKS controls when add-ins can do work. An add-in is unable to do any real work within the PropertyManager2Handler5::OnClose handler because the PropertyManager page and command are closing. So, typically the[IPropertyPage2Handler5::AfterClose](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swpublished~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swpublished.IPropertyManagerPage2Handler5~AfterClose.html)handler is called after IPropertyManager2Handler5::OnClose to allow an add-in to do work. However:

(Table)=========================================================

| If PropertyManager page is... | And you implemented the handler in... | Then you... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Not pinned | C++ | Can prevent the PropertyManager page from closing by setting the HRESULT return value to S_false. |
|  | Visual Basic | Should use the Err.Raise method with a value of 1 to prevent the PropertyManager page from closing. In VB.NET, use 0 with Err.Raise. |
|  | NOTE: When control returns to SOLIDWORKS: The IPropertyManager page remains displayed on the screen. The IPropertyManagerPage2Handler5::AfterClose handler is not called. |  |
| Pinned | C++ or Visual Basic | Set HRESULT to S_false to close the PropertyManager page (i.e., ignore the fact that the page is pinned). This allows your add-in to call the IPropertyManagerPage2Handler5::AfterClose handler and do its work. To avoid aggravating your user, who expected the PropertyManager page to remain pinned, you should re-display and re-pin the PropertyManager page after the add-in finishes its work. |

NOTE:In a previous version of this method,[IPropertyManagerPage2Handler3::OnClose](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swpublished~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swpublished.IPropertyManagerPage2Handler3~OnClose.html), if the user clicked the Cancel button and the PropertyManager page had a pushpin, then this method returned swPropertyManagerPageClose_Closed. This version of this method returns swPropertyManagerPageClose_Cancel in this scenario.
