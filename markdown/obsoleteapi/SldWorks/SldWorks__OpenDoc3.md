# SldWorks::OpenDoc3

This method is obsolete and has been superseded by[SldWorks::OpenDoc4](SldWorks__OpenDoc4.htm)

Description

This method opens an existing document of Name
and Type and returns a pointer to the document object. It also allows
control over whether or not to suppress display of dialog boxes, opening
the documen read-only, opening the document view-only and converting a
drawing to a RapidDraft drawing.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = SldWorks.OpenDoc3 ( filename, type, readOnly,
viewOnly, RapidDraft, silent, &errors)

(Table)=========================================================

| Input: | (BSTR) filename | Document name or full path, if not in current
directory, including extension |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) type | Document type as defined in swDocumentTypes_e |
| Input: | (BOOL) readOnly | TRUE to open read only, FALSE otherwise |
| Input: | (BOOL) viewOnly | TRUE to open view only, FALSE otherwise |
| Input: | (BOOL) RapidDraft | TRUE to convert a Drawing to a RapidDraft drawing,
FALSE otherwise; only valid for drawings |
| Input: | (BOOL) silent | TRUE to open silently, FALSE otherwise |
| Output: | (long) errors | Load errors as defined in swFileLoadError_e |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to a Dispatch object, the newly loaded
ModelDoc, or NULL if fails to open |

Syntax (COM)

status = SldWorks->IOpenDoc3 ( filename, type,
readOnly, viewOnly, RapidDraft, silent, &errors, &retval)

(Table)=========================================================

| Input: | (BSTR) filename | Document name or full path, if not in current
directory, including extension |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) type | Document type as defined in swDocumentTypes_e |
| Input: | (VARIANT_BOOL) readOnly | TRUE to open read only, FALSE otherwise |
| Input: | (VARIANT_BOOL) viewOnly | TRUE to open view only, FALSE otherwise |
| Input: | (VARIANT_BOOL) RapidDraft | TRUE to convert a Drawing to a RapidDraft drawing,
FALSE otherwise ; only valid for drawings |
| Input: | (VARIANT_BOOL) silent | TRUE to open silently, FALSE otherwise |
| Input: | (long) errors | Load errors as defined in swFileLoadError_e |
| Output: | (LPMODELDOC) retval | Pointer to the newly loaded ModelDoc or NULL
if fails to open |
| Return: | (HRESULT) retval | S_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method fires the SldWorksEvents::FileOpenNotify
event. Also, SldWorksEvents::ActiveDocChangeNotify and SldWorksEvents::ActiveModelDocChangeNotify
events are sent if the file being loaded is not already open as the active
document.

NOTE:Calling
this method does not change the current working directory to that of the
opened file, whereas, interactively using the File Open dialog box does.
This can affect documents with references.

When opening a parent document (assembly, drawing,
and so on) any additional documents that are referenced in the parent
document (parts, subassemblies, and so on) are also opened.

When opening these parent files, certain rules
are followed in trying to locate thier referenced documents. If search
folders have not been set usingTools,
Options,l ExternalReferences, then the first place for the referenced
documents searched is in the current working directory. If the referenced
file are found in the current working directory, then it is loaded from
that directory.

Interactively performing File, Open immediately
sets the current working directory to that of the document being opened.
However, the OpenDoc methods do not set the current working directory.
Because the end-user may have interactively opened files from some random
directory, you cannot be certain that the current working directory is
pointing to the desired location. This can affect the referenced documents
that get loaded when using any of the OpenDoc methods versus performingFile, Openinteractively. Because
of this, consider setting the current working directory before calling
any of the OpenDoc methods. This can be done using the SldWorks::SetCurrentWorkingDirectory.
To imitate theFile, Opendialog,
set the current working directory to that of the file being opened.

When opening files that contain references, consider
the current search folder settings because this may affect the references
that get loaded. This can be done programmatically using SldWorks::GetSearchFolders
and SldWorks::SetSearchFolders. If search folders are currently in use,
references are searched for in the search folders before trying to locate
references in the current working directory.

This method does not activate and display the document
if the file is already open in memory in an assembly or drawing. However,
this method should return a valid ModelDoc pointer that is usable with
functions that do not require a document to be displayed. If you wish,
SldWorks::ActivateDoc2 activates and displays the document. Because calling
this method does not activate nor display the file, calling the SldWorks::ActiveDoc
property would not return a pointer to this document.

To open a library feature part, use swDocPART for
the Type argument.

To open foreign files (IGES, STEP, and so on) use
SldWorks::LoadFile2.
