# ModelDoc2::InsertSweepRefSurface

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by[ModelDoc2::InsertSweepRefSurface2](ModelDoc2__InsertSweepRefSurface2.htm).

Description

This method creates a reference surface by sweeping the selected profile
along the selected sweep curves. Because you are creating a surface, the
sections can be open.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc2.InsertSweepRefSurface
( propagate, twistCtrlOption, keepTangency, forceNonRational)

(Table)=========================================================

| Input: | (BOOL) propagate | If TRUE, then the sweep propagates to the next edge, FALSE causes the
sweep to occur only on the selected edge; to propagate to the next edge,
the next edge must be tangent to the current edge |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (short) twistCtrlOption | Twist control options: 0
= Follow path 1
= Keep constant normal 2
= Follow path and first guide curve 3
= Follow first and second guide curve |
| Input: | (BOOL) keepTangency | Follow path |
| Input: | (BOOL) forceNonRational | Keep constant normal |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->InsertSweepRefSurface
( propagate, twistCtrlOption, keepTangency, forceNonRational )

(Table)=========================================================

| Input: | (VARIANT_BOOL) propagate | If TRUE, then the sweep propagates to the next edge, FALSE causes the
sweep to occur only on the selected edge; to propagate to the next edge,
the next edge must be tangent to the current edge |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (short) twistCtrlOption | Twist control options: 0
= Follow path 1
= Keep constant normal 2
= Follow path and first guide curve 3
= Follow first and second guide curve |
| Input: | (VARIANT_BOOL) keepTangency | Follow path |
| Input: | (VARIANT_BOOL) forceNonRational | Keep constant normal |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S_OK if successful |

Remarks

Use ModelDocExtension::SelectByIDto select
the profile and sweep curves. Use these marks:

- 1 = profile selection
- 4 = sweep path
- 2 = guide curve selection, if provided
