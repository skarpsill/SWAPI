# ModelDoc2::InsertProtrusionBlend4

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by FeatureManager::InsertProtrusionBlend .

Description

This method creates a lofted body or boss cut from the selected profiles,
centerline, and guide curves.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc2.InsertProtrusionBlend4 ( closed, keepTangency,
forceNonRational, tessToleranceFactor, startMatchingType, endMatchingType,
isThinBody, thickness1, thickness2, thinType)

(Table)=========================================================

| Input: | (BOOL) closed | TRUE for closed loft, FALSE for open loft; if TRUE, and if you have
selected less that three profiles, then any selected guide curves must
be closed curves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BOOL) keepTangency | If the section curves are tangent, then you have the option to specify
whether the resulting faces will also be tangent; specify TRUE to maintain
the tangency as seen in the section curves, FALSE otherwise; when generating
tangent surfaces, planar and cylindrical surface shapes are maintained
if the section curves exhibit these characteristics |
| Input: | (BOOL) forceNonRational | TRUE to force the resulting surface to be non-rational, FALSE otherwise |
| Input: | (double) tessToleranceFactor | Factor to control the number of intermediate sections used for loft
with centerline; default value is 1.0; the greater the variable, the more
intermediate sections are created |
| Input: | (short) startMatchingType | Tangency type |
| Input: | (short) endMatchingType | Tangency type |
| Input: | (BOOL) isThinBody | TRUE if this feature is a thin body, FALSE otherwise |
| Input: | (double) thickness1 | Thickness value for the first direction |
| Input: | (double) thickness2 | Thickness value for the second direction |
| Input: | (short) thinType | TRUE if this feature is a thin feature, FALSE otherwise |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->InsertProtrusionBlend4 ( closed,
keepTangency, forceNonRational, tessToleranceFactor, startMatchingType,
endMatchingType, isThinBody, thickness1, thickness2, thinType )

(Table)=========================================================

| Input: | (VARIANT_BOOL) closed | TRUE for closed loft, FALSE for open loft; if TRUE, and if you have

be closed curves |

| Input: | (VARIANT_BOOL) keepTangency | If the section curves are tangent, then you have the option to specify
whether the resulting faces will also be tangent; specify TRUE to maintain
the tangency as seen in the section curves, FALSE otherwise; when generating

if the section curves exhibit these characteristics |

| Input: | (double) tessToleranceFactor | Factor to control the number of intermediate sections used for loft

intermediate sections are created |
| Input: | (short) startMatchingType | Tangency type |
| Input: | (short) endMatchingType | Tangency type |
| Input: | (VARIANT_BOOL) isThinBody | TRUE if this feature is a thin body, FALSE otherwise |
| Input: | (double) thickness1 | Thickness value for the first direction |
| Input: | (double) thickness2 | Thickness value for the second direction |
| Input: | (short) thinType | TRUE if this feature is a thin feature, FALSE otherwise |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S_OK if successful |

Remarks

Selection of guide curves and centerline is optional; however, selection
of the profiles must be in an order consistent with the desired direction
of the loft. Because you are creating a surface, the section profiles
can be open.

Use of guide curves is recommended, especially when selection of profiles
is done in the FeatureManager design tree. You can use any number of profiles;
however, if you have selected only one profile, then any selected guide
curves must be closed curves.

Use ModelDocExtension::SelectByIDto select
the profiles and guide curves. The mark for:

- profile selections should be 1
- any guide curve selection, if provided, should
  be a 2
- centerline selection, if provided, should be a
  4
- start tangency vector selection, if provided,
  should be a 8
- start tangency faces selection, if provided, should
  be a 16 (not available)
- end tangency vector selection, if provided, should
  be a 32
- end tangency faces selection, if provided, should
  be a 64 (not available)

NOTE:Linear edge, sketch line,
axis, plane, and planar faces are qualified for tangency vector sections.

The tangency types can be one these:

- 0 none
- 1 tangent
  to the normal of the profile
- 2 tangent
  to a selected vector
- 3 tangency
  to all the adjacent faces sharing an edge with the start profile
- 4 tangent
  to some of the selected faces sharing an edge with the start profile (not
  available)
