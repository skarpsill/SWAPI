# ModelDoc::FeatureCut3

This
method is now obsolete and is superseded by[ModelDoc::FeatureCut4](ModelDoc__FeatureCut4.htm).

Description

This method creates cut feature.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc.FeatureCut3
( sd, flip, dir, t1, t2, d1, d2, dchk1, dchk2, ddir1, ddir2, dang1, dang2,
offsetReverse1, offsetReverse2, keepPieceIndex )

(Table)=========================================================

| Input: | (BOOL) sd | TRUE for single ended, FALSE for double ended |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BOOL) flip | Flip side to cut; TRUE if you want to remove the material outside of
the profile |
| Input: | (BOOL) dir | Reverse direction; TRUE if you want Direction1 to be opposite the default
direction |
| Input: | (long) t1 | Termination type for first end |
| Input: | (long) t2 | Termination type for second end |
| Input: | (double) d1 | Depth of extrusion for first end in meters |
| Input: | (double) d2 | Depth of extrusion for second end in meters |
| Input: | (BOOL) dchk1 | TRUE allows draft angle in first direction, FALSE does not allow drafting |
| Input: | (BOOL) dchk2 | TRUE allows draft angle in second direction, FALSE does not allow drafting |
| Input: | (BOOL) ddir1 | For first draft angle to be inward use TRUE, for draft angle outward
use FALSE |
| Input: | (BOOL) ddir2 | For second draft angle to be inward use TRUE, for draft angle outward
use FALSE |
| Input: | (double) dang1 | Draft angle for first end |
| Input: | (double) dang2 | Draft angle for second end |
| Input: | (BOOL) offsetReverse1 | If you chose to offset the first end condition from another face or
plane, then TRUE specifies offset in direction away from the sketch and
FALSE would specify offset from the face or plane in a direction toward
the sketch |
| Input: | (BOOL) offsetReverse2 | If you chose to offset the second end condition from another face or
plane, then TRUE specifies offset in direction away from the sketch and
FALSE would specify offset from the face or plane in a direction toward
the sketch |
| Input: | (long) keepPieceIndex | Piece to keep if there is ambiguity |

Remarks

Termination type may be any of the values as defined in swEndConditions_e.

The default direction for dut operations are opposite the sketch normal.
The default direction for boss operations is along the sketch normal.
Setting the dir argument to TRUE reverses the default direction. For double-ended
extrusions, Direction2 will always be opposite to Direction1.

The default sketch normal will be the same as the face or plane normal
where the sketch was placed. To determine this normal vector, use Face::Normal
and RefPlane::GetRefPlaneParams, respectively.

When there is ambiguity in the result of a cut, the keepPieceIndex is
used to resolve which of the possible results is used. This can be set
to -1 if there is no ambiguity; otherwise, it should be the index of the
result, starting from 0 (up to 1 less than the possible number of outcomes).
