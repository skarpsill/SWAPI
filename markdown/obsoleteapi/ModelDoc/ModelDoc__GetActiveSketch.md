# ModelDoc::GetActiveSketch

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by[ModelDoc::GetActiveSketch2](ModelDoc__GetActiveSketch2.htm).

Description

This method returns the active sketch in document. If no sketch is currently
active, or if the active sketch is a 3D sketch, then NULL is returned.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.GetActiveSketch ()

(Table)=========================================================

| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to a Dispatch object, a sketch |
| --- | --- | --- |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->IGetActiveSketch
( &retval )

(Table)=========================================================

| Output: | (LPSKETCH) retval | Pointer to a Sketch object |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S_OK if successful |

Remarks

Before you can use this method, you must select
and activate a sketch. You can use ModelDoc::SelectByID to select a sketch
and ModelDoc::InsertSketch2 to make the sketch active.

To avoid regressions in existing applications,
this method returns NULL if the active sketch is a 3D sketch. To access
the active 2D or 3D sketch, see GetActiveSketch2. To determine if a Sketch
object is 2D or 3D, use Sketch::Is3D.
