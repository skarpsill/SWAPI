# ModelDoc::FeatureFillet2

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by[ModelDoc::FeatureFillet3](ModelDoc__FeatureFillet3.htm).

Description

This method creates a fillet feature.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.FeatureFillet2
( r1, propagate, ftyp, varRadTyp, overFlowType, radii)

(Table)=========================================================

| Input: | (double) r1 | Radius for end1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BOOL) propagate | TRUE to propagate the blend, FALSE otherwise |
| Input: | (BOOL) ftyp | 0 for simple fillet, 1 for variable radius fillet |
| Input: | (BOOL) varRadTyp | 0 for linear, 1 for smooth transition (variable radius) |
| Input: | (long) overFlowType | Control of fillet overflowing onto adjacent surfaces |
| Input: | (VARIANT) radii | SafeArray containing the radii for variable radius fillets |
| Return: | (long) retval | 1 if the fillet was created, otherwise 0 |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->IFeatureFillet2(
r1, propagate, ftyp, varRadTyp, overFlowType, nRadii, radii, &retval
)

(Table)=========================================================

| Input: | (double) r1 | Radius for end1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT_BOOL) propagate | TRUE to propagate the blend, FALSE otherwise |
| Input: | (VARIANT_BOOL) ftyp | 0 for simple fillet, 1 for variable radius fillet |
| Input: | (VARIANT_BOOL) varRadTyp | 0 for linear, 1 for smooth transition (variable radius) |
| Input: | (long) overFlowType | Control of fillet overflowing onto adjacent surfaces |
| Input: | (int) nRadii | Number of radii for variable radius fillets |
| Input: | (double*) radii | Array containing the radii for variable radius fillets |
| Output: | (long)retval | 1 if the fillet was created, otherwise 0 |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S_OK if successful |

Remarks

For variable radius fillets, the r1 argument is ignored as the radii
array contains values for all the radii.

The overFlowType argument controls how the fillet
behaves when it meats adjacent surfaces:

- 0 - Default: The system
  picks the appropriate method to create a fillet when the fillet surface
  overflows to adjacent surfaces. It either smoothly blends with adjacent
  surfaces or limits the fillet surface with the adjacent edges, thus, not
  changing the edge, or trims the fillet surface by the adjacent surface
  on to which the fillet overflows. The method is used by default and depends
  on the geometric condition. This option always tries to create a fillet
  if possible.
- 1 - Keep Edge: The edges
  that are overflowed by the fillet are not modified. The fillet surface
  iskadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}trimmed
  by all the adjacent edges. As a result, an additional transition fillet
  surface might be needed to complete the fillet.
- 2 - Keep Surface: The
  fillet surface either merges with the adjacent surfaces smoothly or is
  trimmed by the adjacent surfaces. As a result, it is unlikely that an
  additional transition fillet surface is created.
