Remarks

This method returns an array containing the definition of all of the
entities that describe a trimmed face. The data is arranged in collections
of surface curves (curves defined in the 2-D parametric space of the surface,
or SP curves) organized into loops (closed composite curves).

All SP curves are returned as b-splines. To control the tolerance of
the SP curves, use[Modeler::SetTolerances](../Modeler/Modeler__SetTolerances.htm).

For IGetTrimCurve2, a call to[Face::IGetTrimCurveSize2](Face__IGetTrimCurveSize2.htm)must precede the call to IGetTrimCurve2 to get the size of the array required
and pre-process the trim curve data.

The surface and trim curve parameterization returned by this method
might be different from the parameterization returned by other methods,
such as[Face::GetUVBounds](Face__GetUVBounds.htm), Surface::Parameterization,[Edge::GetCurveParams](../Edge/Edge__GetCurveParams.htm), and
so on.

If you set wantCubic to TRUE, then this method returns the underlying
Bsurface definition. If you want to use the Bsurface in combination with
its trim curves, set wantCubic=TRUE since it provides better alignment
of the trim curves with the Bsurface because they are generated at the
same time.

Each face typically has at least one outer loop and zero or more inner
loops. Outer loops define the periphery of the face; inner loops define
holes in the face. Outer loops are returned before inner loops if possible.
If you need to be certain, use Loop2::IsOuter.

#### Periodic Faces

Periodic faces present many obstacles in translation. As a general rule,
it is best to chop up all periodic surfaces by making a call to Body::GetProcessedBody.
This function will return a new body to the caller with periodic faces
chopped up into multiple faces. Processing this new body, instead of the
original body, will avoid many of the pitfalls (see below) associated
with periodics.

If this face is periodic and crosses the "seam" (0 & 360
degree location), then this method will split the face into more than
one trimmed surface for the purposes of returning this set of data. The
first time that this function is called on any face, it will return data
for the first trimmed surface on the face. Each subsequent call to this
function on thesameface will
return data for the next trimmed surface, if one exists. Refer to thepackedDouble8parameter to determine
the number of surfaces for this face.

To avoid the return of multiple surfaces per face, we recommend processing
the body returned from Body::GetProcessedBody.

In addition, using the body object returned from Body::GetProcessedBody
will usually prevent GetTrimCurves2 from returning multiple outer loops
when it encounters certain periodic surfaces. In other words, it can prevent
GetTrimCurves2 from generating multiple faces (each with an outer loop)
for a particular periodic surface.

#### Edges

If your program uses calls to both[Face::GetEdges](Face__GetEdges.htm)and GetTrimCurves2 or to both[Face::EnumEdges](Face__EnumEdges.htm)and GetTrimCurves2, then you should be aware of the following:

GetTrimCurves2 stores a temporary buffer
containing the edges for this face. If this temporary buffer exists, then
calls to Face::GetEdgesor Face::EnumEdges
access the buffer. This is beneficial if you are attempting to align the
trim curves of the face with their corresponding Edges. If your call to
Face::GetEdgesor Face::EnumEdges is made immediately
following your call to GetTrimCurves2, then the order of the trim curves
will align with the order of the Edges. However, if you are processing
all the trimcurves and then processing all the edges, you will find that
your first call to access the edges will use the temporary buffer of edges
generated in your last call to GetTrimCurves2. Since your last call to
GetTrimCurves2 and your current call to get the edges were probably made
from different faces, you will see a mismatch of data. This mismatch of
data may been seen when GetEdgeCount does not match the SafeArray size
from Face::GetEdgesor it may be seen when
the edge data does not match the face being examined. Therefore, calls
to Face::GetEdgesor Face::EnumEdges should
be made in the same loop and immediately following your call to Face::GetEdges.
The temporary buffer of edges is destroyed after each call to Face::GetEdgesor Face::EnumEdges.

There might not be a corresponding edge for each trim curve. This is
especially true for periodic surfaces for which no edge exists along the
seam (0 and 360 degree location), yet this method returns a trim curve.
You can detect this situation by simply comparing the number of edges
on the face,[Face::GetEdgeCount](Face__GetEdgeCount.htm),
with the number of trim (SP) curves on the face, PackedDouble1 (see below).

To force edge generation along the seam
of a periodic surface, use Body::GetProcessedBody. This method creates
a copy of the body with faces and surfaces chopped up. However, there
are still certain situations (poles of a surface, cusps on a surface,
and so on) in which this method returns a trim curve where no edge exists.
In this situation, the list of edges returned from GetEdges or EnumEdges
does not align with the list of trim curves. Again, you can detect this
by comparing the value returnedby GetEdgeCount with PackedDouble1
(see below), but you need to handle matching the edges with their corresponding
trim curve.

#### Return Values

The data is returned in a large array of doubles. Integer data is packed
among the doubles in pairs.

The format offaceData[]
is as follows:

[ packedDouble1, packedDouble2[ ], packedDouble3[
], knotValues[ ], ctrlPointCoords[ ], packedDouble8 ]

(Table)=========================================================

| packedDouble1 | An integer pair containing number of loops and total number of SP curves
(trim curves). The length of any edge list generated immediately after
a call to GetTrimCurves2 will
be equal to the number of SP curves. |
| --- | --- |
| packedDouble2[ ] | Series of integer pairs containing the number of SP curves in each loop;
the first integer in each pair represents the number of curves in the
odd loops, the second represents the even. The total number of integer
pairs here is half the number of loops, rounded up |
| packedDouble3[ ] | For each SP curve, a set of two integer pairs. The first contains the
order of the curve and a boolean indicating if it is periodic. If the
curve is periodic, it will be clamped (that is, knots of multiplicity
= order will exist at each end of the curve). The second contains the
dimension of the curve and the number of control points in it. If the
dimension is 2, the curve is non-rational; if the dimension is 3 the curve
is rational. |
| knotValues[ ] | Array of doubles containing the knot values for all the SP curves in
order. The number of knots for each curve is equal to the order of the
curve plus the number of control points. |
| ctrlPointCoords[ ] | Array of doubles containing the coordinates of the control points for
all the SP curves in order. These are given as a sequence of (U,V) pairs
if non-rational, and (U,V,W) triples if rational, where W is the homogeneous
coordinate known as the weight. |
| packedDouble8 | Integer pair as follows: the first integer is the total number of trimmed
surfaces being output for the given face (the modeler sometimes outputs
more than one trimmed surface for a face). The second integer indicates
the index of the current trimmed surface being output. All the data in
the faceData [] array is for the
current trimmed surface. Therefore, if packedDouble8 says there are two trim surfaces, you should use the same Face pointer
and call GetTrimCurves2 again
to get the data for the second trim surface. |

If b-splines were requested
(WantCubic = TRUE), then the underlying Bsurface is also returned. The
faceData[ ] array would be as follows:

[ packedDouble1, packedDouble2[ ], packedDouble3[
], knotValues[ ], ctrlPointCoords[ ], packedDouble4, packedDouble5, packedDouble6,
packedDouble7, surfaceKnotValuesU[ ], surfaceKnotValuesV[ ], surfaceCtrlPointCoords[
], packedDouble8 ]

(Table)=========================================================

| packedDouble1 | See definition above. |
| --- | --- |
| packedDouble2[ ] | See definition above. |
| packedDouble3[ ] | See definition above. |
| knotValues[ ] | See definition above. |
| ctrlPointCoords[ ] | See definition above. |
| packedDouble4 | Integer pair containing the dimension of the surface. (3 is non-rational
and 4 is rational). The second member of the pair is not used and contains
a zero. |
| PackedDouble5 | Integer pair containing the U-order and the V-order of the surface. |
| PackedDouble6 | Integer pair containing the number of control points in U and the number
of control points in V |
| packedDouble7 | Integer pair containing booleans indicating if the surface is periodic
in U and in V. If the surface is periodic, it will be clamped (that is,
knots of multiplicity = order will exist at each end of the surface). |
| surfaceKnotValuesU[ ] | Array of doubles containing the knot values in U for the surface. The
number of knots in U is equal to the order in U plus the number of control
points in U. |
| surfaceKnotValuesV[ ] | Array of doubles containing the knot values in V as above for U. |
| surfaceCtrlPointCoords[ ] | Array of doubles containing the coordinates of the control points for
the surface. These are given as a sequence of (X,Y,Z) triples if non-rational,
and (X,Y,Z,W) tuples if rational, where W is the homogeneous coordinate
known as the weight. The coordinates are given in row-wise order (V varying
most quickly). |
| packedDouble8 | See definition above. |
