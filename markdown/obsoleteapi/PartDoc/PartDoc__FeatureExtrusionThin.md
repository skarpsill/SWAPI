# PartDoc::FeatureExtrusionThin

This
method is now obsolete and has been superseded by[PartDoc::FeatureExtrusionThin2](PartDoc__FeatureExtrusionThin2.htm).

Description

This methodcreates
a feature by extruding a profile. A constant thickness is given to profile
during extruding.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

(void) PartDoc.FeatureExtrusionThin
( sd, flip, dir, t1, t2, d1, d2, dchk1, dchk2, ddir1, ddir2, dang1, dang2,
offsetReverse1, offsetReverse2, thk1, thk2, capThk, thinType, capEnds,
addFillets, filletRad )

| Input: | (BOOL) sd | TRUE for single-ended, FALSE for double-ended |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BOOL) flip | Not used |

| Input: | (double) d1 | Depth of extrusion for first end in meters |
| Input: | (double) d2 | Depth of extrusion for second end in meters |
| Input: | (BOOL) dchk1 | TRUE allows draft angle in first direction, FALSE does not allow drafting |
| Input: | (BOOL) dchk2 | TRUE allows draft angle in second direction, FALSE does not allow drafting |
| Input: | (BOOL) ddir1 | For first draft angle to be inward use TRUE, for draft angle outward
use FALSE |

plane, then TRUE specifies offset in direction away from the sketch, FALSE
specifies offset from the face or plane in a direction toward the sketch |
| Input: | (double) thk1 | Wall thickness 1; midplane type uses (thk1)/2 for each direction |
| Input: | (double) thk2 | Wall thickness 2; only used when thinType = 3 |
| Input: | (double) capThk | End-cap thickness; only used when capEnds = 1 |
| Input: | (long) thinType | Thin feature type: 0 = One direction 1 = One direction reverse 2 = Midplane 3 = Two direction |
| Input: | (long) capEnds | Cap the ends: 0 = no cap 1 = cap (base features only) |
| Input: | (Boolean)addFillets | TRUE to add auto fillets (open Profile base features only) |

Remarks

The default direction for cut operations is opposite the sketch normal.
The default direction for boss operations is along the sketch normal.
Setting the dir argument to TRUE reverses the default direction. For double-ended
extrusions, Direction 2 is always opposite to Direction 1.

The default sketch normal is the same as the face or plane normal where
the sketch was placed. To determine this normal vector, see Face2::Normal
and RefPlane::GetRefPlaneParams,kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}respectively.
