# View::GetPolylines5

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by[View::GetPolylines6](View__GetPolylines6.htm).

Description

This method gets all of the
polylines in the view with an option to include or exclude crosshatch
lines.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = View.GetPolyLines5 ( crossHatchOption )

(Table)=========================================================

| Input: | (short) crossHatchOption | 0
= include crosshatch lines 1
= exclude crosshatch lines 2
= include only crosshatch lines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | Array of lines in the view |

Syntax (COM)

status = View->IGetPolylines5 ( crossHatchOption,
arraySize, retVal )

Parameters Table Start

(Table)=========================================================

| Input: | (short) crossHatchOption | 0
= include crosshatch lines 1
= exclude crosshatch lines 2
= include only crosshatch lines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) arraySize | Size of array |
| Output: | (double*) retVal | Array of lines in the view of size arraySize |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S_OK if successful |

Remarks

The difference between this method and View::GetPolyLinesAndCurves is
that splines and ellipses returned by View::GetPolyLinesAndCurves are
returned as equation parameters, which are more precise definitions.

This method returns data for all visible solid
model edges in the drawing view. This includes these types of edges:

- arcs: Returned
  using a center point, radius, and start and stop location.
- circles:
  Returned using a center point, radius, and start and stop location.
- ellipses:
  Returned as tessellated polylines.
- splines:
  Returned as tessellated polylines.
- straight
  lines: Returned as tessellated polylines, but because the edges are straight,
  there is no loss of data in the approximation.

This method also lets you include or exclude crosshatch
lines. This method does not return data for sketch segments added by a
user in the drawing view.

| To get... | Call... |

| Size of array needed to hold this data in COM applications | View::GetPolylineCount5 |
| Items that were sketched in this drawing view | View::GetArcs4 View::GetLines4 View::GetSplines3 View::GetEllipses5 |

Format of the return value is the following array of doubles:

[Type, GeomDataSize, GeomData[ ], LineColor,
LineStyle, LineFont, LineWeight, LayerID, LayerOverride, NumPolyPoints,
[x,y,z]]

where:

Type=underlying geometry type, possible
values are:

GeomDataSize=
number of elements in theGeomDataarray, for Type = 0 this will be 0.

GeomData[
]= geometric data that can be used to represent the underlying
geometry type. The data returned in this array is based on the underlying
geometry type:

LineColor=
polyline color. This value is determined either by the explicitly set
value or by the layer that the polyline is on.

LineStyle=
value combines polyline font and weight information. This value can be
used as an input to GetLineFontInfo and GetLineFontName. If this value
is -1, then the user has probably modified the line display manually in
the drawing and you should use the LineFont and LineWeight return values
to recreate the exact polyline style.

LineFont=
value is used for polyline font information. This value can be used as
an input to the GetLineFontInfo2 and GetLineFontName2 functions. This
value will only be valid if LineStyle is -1.

LineWeight=
polyline weight where Thin = 0.0, Normal = 1.0, Thick = 2.0. This value
will only be valid if LineStyle is -1.

LayerID=
integer value indicating which layer holds this polyline. The Layer object
can be obtained by passing this integer value to LayerMgr::GetLayerById.

LayerOverride=
integer with bit flags set to determine which properties, if any, have
been overridden with respect to the Layer default properties. If the bit
value is set, then the specific property or properties have been overridden.
The bit indicators are: color = 0x1, style = 0x2, and width = 0x4. Therefore,
if LayerOverride was returned as 3, you know the color and style have
been specifically set for this item and may not match the default values
associated with this item's layer.

NumPolyPoints=
number of XYZ points found in the [x,y,z] return value

[x,y,z]=
array of points used to describe the polyline. This array has NumPolyPoints
points. This data will be returned for every polyline regardless ofType.

(Table)=========================================================

| If... | Then... |
| --- | --- |
| Display mode of the view is: Shaded Shaded with Edges Draft Quality Fast HLR/HLV | A value is not returned. Use View::SetDisplayMode3 to change Shaded or Shaded with Edges mode
to Wireframe, Hidden Lines Removed (HLR), or Hidden Lines Visible (HLV),
and then get the polylines. |
| Changes are made to the parts or assemblies shown in this drawing | Polylines are only generated that are in the visible viewing bounds
when the drawing is opened. |
| Drawing is already open | All polylines in the drawing are generated. If you open a drawing that
is zoomed in to a particular region, then the polylines that are outside
the zoomed region do not exist if the parts or assemblies shown in this
drawing have been changed. To force the generation of all possible polyline
data, call ModelDoc2::ViewZoomtofit2. |
