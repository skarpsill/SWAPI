# Run PowerSelect Example (VBA)

This example shows how to initialize, run, and close a PowerSelect session
using the SOLIDWORKS Utilities API.

```
'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Add the SOLIDWORKS Utilities as an add-in
'    (in SOLIDWORKS, click Tools > Add-Ins > SOLIDWORKS Utilities).
' 2. Add the SOLIDWORKS Utilities type library as a reference
'    (in the SOLIDWORKS Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications IDE, click
'    Tools > References > SolidWorks Utilities <version> Type Library).
' 3. Open public_documents\samples\tutorial\introtosw\pressure_plate.sldprt.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Runs PowerSelect and selects the specified types of edges.
' 2. Examine the graphics area.
'
' NOTE: Because the part is used elsewhere, do not save changes.
