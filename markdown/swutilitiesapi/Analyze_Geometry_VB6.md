# Analyze Geometry Example (VBA)

This example shows how to analyze the geometry of a part using the SOLIDWORKS
Utilities API.

```
'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Add the SOLIDWORKS Utilities as an add-in
'    (in SOLIDWORKS, click Tools > Add-Ins > SOLIDWORKS Utilities).
' 2. Add the SOLIDWORKS Utilities type library as a reference
'    (in the SOLIDWORKS Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications IDE, click
'    Tools > References > SolidWorks Utilities <version> Type Library).
' 3. Verify that C:\test\ exists.
' 4. Open a part.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Analyzes the geometry and creates a report,
'    C:\test\AnalyzeGeometry\gtReportIndex.htm.
' 2. Examine C:\test\AnalyzeGeometry\gtReportIndex.htm.
