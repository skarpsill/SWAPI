```vb
Dim instance As ICWMaterial
Dim value As System.Boolean

instance.IncludeCreep2 = value

value = instance.IncludeCreep2
```

### C#

System.bool IncludeCreep2 {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.bool IncludeCreep2 {
   System.bool get();
   void set (    System.bool value);
}
```
