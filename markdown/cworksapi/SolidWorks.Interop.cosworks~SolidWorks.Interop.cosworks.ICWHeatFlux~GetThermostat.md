# GetThermostat Method (ICWHeatFlux)

Gets the location of the thermostat for heat flux.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetThermostat() As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICWHeatFlux
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.GetThermostat()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object GetThermostat()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ GetThermostat();
```

### Return Value

Vertex of the location of the thermostat

## VBA Syntax
