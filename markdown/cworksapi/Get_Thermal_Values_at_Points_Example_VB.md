# Get Thermal Values Example (VBA)

This example shows how to get thermal values in a thermal study.

```vb
 '---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
 ' 1. Add the SOLIDWORKS Simulation as an add-in (in SOLIDWORKS, click
 '    Tools > Add-ins > SOLIDWORKS Simulation > OK).
 ' 2. Add the SOLIDWORKS Simulation type library as a reference (in the IDE,
 '    click Tools > References > SOLIDWORKS Simulation version type library).
 ' 3. Ensure that the specified model exists.
 ' 4. Modify the path to solidworks materials.sldmat if needed.
 ' 5. Uncomment the thermal method whose return values you want to see.
 ' 6. Open the Immediate window.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1.  Opens document.
 ' 2.  Creates Thermal_One study.
 ' 3.  Applies user-defined and SOLIDWORKS materials to components.
 ' 4.  Gets objects by persistent reference and populates input arrays.
 ' 5.  Sets thermal study options.
 ' 6.  Assigns initial temperatures to assembly components.
 ' 7.  Adds heat power and convection to assembly components.
 ' 8.  Assigns thermostat location and the temperature range.
 ' 9.  Meshes the assembly.
 ' 10. Analyzes the study.
 ' 11. Prints thermal values at solution step 60 to the Immediate window.
 '
 ' NOTES:
 '  * To get persistent reference identifiers (PIDs) for model selections,
 '    use  pidcollector.exe or IModelDocExtension::GetPersistReference3.
 '  * Solving this study can take some time. Examine the Immediate window
 '    to monitor the macro's progress. Done! indicates that the macro
 '    has finished.
 '  * Because this assembly document is used by a SOLIDWORKS Simulation
 '    online tutorial, do not save any changes.
