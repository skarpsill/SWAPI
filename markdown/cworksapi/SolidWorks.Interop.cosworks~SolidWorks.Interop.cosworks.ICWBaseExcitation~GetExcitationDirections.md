# GetExcitationDirections Method (ICWBaseExcitation)

Obsolete. Superseded by

[ICWBaseExcitation::GetExcitationDirections2](SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks~SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks.ICWBaseExcitation~GetExcitationDirections2.html)

.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub GetExcitationDirections( _
   ByRef BDir1 As System.Integer, _
   ByRef BDir2 As System.Integer, _
   ByRef BDir3 As System.Integer _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICWBaseExcitation
Dim BDir1 As System.Integer
Dim BDir2 As System.Integer
Dim BDir3 As System.Integer

instance.GetExcitationDirections(BDir1, BDir2, BDir3)
```

### C#

```csharp
void GetExcitationDirections(
   out System.int BDir1,
   out System.int BDir2,
   out System.int BDir3
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void GetExcitationDirections(
   [Out] System.int BDir1,
   [Out] System.int BDir2,
   [Out] System.int BDir3
)
```

### Parameters

- `BDir1`: 1 to get excitation along plane direction 1, 0 to not (see

Remarks

)
- `BDir2`: 1 to get excitation along plane direction 2, 0 to not (see

Remarks

)
- `BDir3`: 1 to get excitation along plane direction 3, 0 to not (see

Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

See

[CWBaseExcitation::GetExcitationDirections](ms-its:cworksapivb6.chm::/CosmosWorksLib~CWBaseExcitation~GetExcitationDirections.html)

.

## Remarks

For uniform base excitations, this method is valid only if you did not call

[ICWBaseExcitation::SetDirectionEntityForUniformExcitation](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks.ICWBaseExcitation~SetDirectionEntityForUniformExcitation.html)

to set the face, edge, or plane in whose direction the excitation is uniformly applied.
