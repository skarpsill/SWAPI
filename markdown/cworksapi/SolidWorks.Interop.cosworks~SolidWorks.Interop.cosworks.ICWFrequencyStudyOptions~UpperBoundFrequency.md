# UpperBoundFrequency Property (ICWFrequencyStudyOptions)

Gets or sets the upper-bound frequency for this frequency study.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property UpperBoundFrequency As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICWFrequencyStudyOptions
Dim value As System.Integer

instance.UpperBoundFrequency = value

value = instance.UpperBoundFrequency
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int UpperBoundFrequency {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.int UpperBoundFrequency {
   System.int get();
   void set (    System.int value);
}
```

### Property Value

Upper-bound frequency
