# SolverType Property (ICWNonLinearStudyOptions)

Gets or sets the solver type associated with the study.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property SolverType As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICWNonLinearStudyOptions
Dim value As System.Integer

instance.SolverType = value

value = instance.SolverType
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int SolverType {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.int SolverType {
   System.int get();
   void set (    System.int value);
}
```

### Property Value

Solver type as defined in[swsSolverType_e](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks.swsSolverType_e.html)(see**Remarks**)

## VBA Syntax

See

[CWNonLinearStudyOptions::SolverType](ms-its:cworksapivb6.chm::/CosmosWorksLib~CWNonLinearStudyOptions~SolverType.html)

.

## Examples

See the

[ICWNonLinearStudyOptions](SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks~SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks.ICWNonLinearStudyOptions.html)

examples.

## Remarks

The automatic solver is not supported for nonlinear studies; it supports static, frequency, and buckling studies only.
