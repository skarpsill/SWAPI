# IncludeThermostat Property (ICWHeatFlux)

Obsolete. Superseded by[ICWHeatFlux::IncludeThermostat2](SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks~SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks.ICWHeatFlux~IncludeThermostat2.html).

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property IncludeThermostat As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICWHeatFlux
Dim value As System.Integer

instance.IncludeThermostat = value

value = instance.IncludeThermostat
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int IncludeThermostat {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.int IncludeThermostat {
   System.int get();
   void set (    System.int value);
}
```

### Property Value

1 to include thermostat effects, 0 to not

## VBA Syntax
