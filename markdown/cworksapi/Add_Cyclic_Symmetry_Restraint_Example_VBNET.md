# Add Cyclic Symmetry Restraint Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to add a cyclic symmetry restraint to a static study.

NOTE:To get persistent reference
identifiers (PIDs) for model selections, you can use[pidcollector.exe](GettingStarted-swsimulationapi.html)or IModelDocExtension::GetPersistReference3.

```vb
  '----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
 ' 1. Add the SOLIDWORKS Simulation as an add-in (in SOLIDWORKS, click
 '    Tools > Add-ins > SOLIDWORKS Simulation > OK).
 ' 2. Add the SOLIDWORKS Simulation primary interop assembly as a reference
 '    (in the IDE, click Project > Add Reference > .NET >
 '    SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks > OK).
 ' 3. Ensure that the specified model document exists.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1. Opens the specified model document.
 ' 2. Gets study, Partial-Solids.
 ' 3. Adds the Cyclic Symmetry-1 fixture to Partial-Solids.
 ' 4. Meshes the model.
 ' 5. Analyzes Partial-Solids.
  ' 6. Inspect the Simulation study tree and the graphics area.
 '
  ' NOTE: Because the model is used elsewhere, do not save changes.
