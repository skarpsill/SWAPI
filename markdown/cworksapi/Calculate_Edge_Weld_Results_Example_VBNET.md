# Calculate Edge Weld Results Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to calculate the edge weld results for a specific edge
weld connector.

```vb
 '---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
 ' 1. Add the SOLIDWORKS Simulation as an add-in (in SOLIDWORKS, click
 '    Tools > Add-ins > SOLIDWORKS Simulation > OK).
 ' 2. Add the SOLIDWORKS Simulation primary interop assembly as a reference
 '    (in the IDE, click Project > Add Reference > .NET >
 '    SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks > OK).
 ' 3. Open the Immediate window.
 ' 4. Verify that the specified model exists.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1. Opens the part document.
 ' 2. Meshes the part.
 ' 3. Sets the solver type.
 ' 4. Runs the analysis.
 ' 5. Gets the edge weld results for Edge Weld Connector-1.
  ' 6. Prints the edge weld results to the Immediate window.
 '
 ' NOTE: Because this part document is used elsewhere,
 ' do not save any changes when closing the document.
