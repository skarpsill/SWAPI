# GetTimeCurve Method (ICWHeatPower)

Gets the time curve data for heat power.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetTimeCurve() As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICWHeatPower
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.GetTimeCurve()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object GetTimeCurve()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ GetTimeCurve();
```

### Return Value

Array of time curve data (see

Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

See

[CWHeatPower::GetTimeCurve](ms-its:cworksapivb6.chm::/CosmosWorksLib~CWHeatPower~GetTimeCurve.html)

.

## Remarks

Time curve data:

**[**`n, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3,...xn, yn`**]**

where:

- n = number of xi,yi pairs
- xi = time value at the`ith`data point
- yi = property value associated with time xi
