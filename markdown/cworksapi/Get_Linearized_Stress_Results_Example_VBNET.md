# Get Linearized Stress Results Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to get the stress results that are linearized along
Stress Classification Lines for a pressure
vessel study.

```vb
'----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
 '  1. Add the SOLIDWORKS Simulation as an add-in (in SOLIDWORKS, click
 '     Tools > Add-ins > SOLIDWORKS Simulation > OK).
 '  2. Add the SOLIDWORKS Simulation type library as a reference (in the IDE,
 '     click  Tools > References > SOLIDWORKS Simulation version type library).
 '  3. Open  pubic_documents\Simulation Examples\pressurevessel.sldprt.
 '  4. Open the Immediate window.
 '  5. Mesh Ready-Solids using a curvature-based mesh with a maximum of 10 elements.
 '  6. Analyze Ready-Solids.
 '  7. Create Pressure Vessel Design 1 study, using a linear combination of
 '      Ready-Solids with Factor = 1.
 '  8. Analyze Pressure Vessel Design 1.
 '  9. Create a default von Mises stress plot of the results.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 '  1. Gets the following stress values linearized along Stress Classification Lines
 '     for the specified points on the planar section created by the Top plane:
 '     * Membrane stress
 '     * Bending (Point 1) stress
 '     * Membrane stress + bending (Point 1) stress
 '     * Bending (Point 2) stress
 '     * Membrane stress + Bending (Point 2) stress
 '     * Peak (Point 1)
 '     * Peak (Point 2)
 '  2. Inspect the Immediate window.
 '
 ' NOTE: Because the model is used elsewhere, do not save any changes.
