```

### C#

```csharp
void HeatFluxBeginEdit()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void HeatFluxBeginEdit();
```

## VBA Syntax

See

[CWHeatFlux::HeatFluxBeginEdit](ms-its:cworksapivb6.chm::/CosmosWorksLib~CWHeatFlux~HeatFluxBeginEdit.html)

.

## Examples

See the

[ICWHeatFlux](SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks~SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks.ICWHeatFlux.html)

examples.

## Remarks

To start editing heat flux, you must call this method. You must call

[ICWHeatFlux::HeatFluxEndEdit](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks.ICWHeatFlux~HeatFluxEndEdit.html)

to end editing heat flux. Changes are not applied unless you call both methods.
