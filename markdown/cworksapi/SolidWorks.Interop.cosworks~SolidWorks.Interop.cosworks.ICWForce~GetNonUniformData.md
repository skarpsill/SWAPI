# GetNonUniformData Method (ICWForce)

Obsolete. Superseded by[ICWForce::Equation](SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks~SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks.ICWForce~Equation.html).

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub GetNonUniformData( _
   ByRef DConstVal As System.Double, _
   ByRef DX As System.Double, _
   ByRef DY As System.Double, _
   ByRef DXY As System.Double, _
   ByRef DX2 As System.Double, _
   ByRef DY2 As System.Double _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICWForce
Dim DConstVal As System.Double
Dim DX As System.Double
Dim DY As System.Double
Dim DXY As System.Double
Dim DX2 As System.Double
Dim DY2 As System.Double

instance.GetNonUniformData(DConstVal, DX, DY, DXY, DX2, DY2)
```

### C#

```csharp
void GetNonUniformData(
   out System.double DConstVal,
   out System.double DX,
   out System.double DY,
   out System.double DXY,
   out System.double DX2,
   out System.double DY2
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void GetNonUniformData(
   [Out] System.double DConstVal,
   [Out] System.double DX,
   [Out] System.double DY,
   [Out] System.double DXY,
   [Out] System.double DX2,
   [Out] System.double DY2
)
```

### Parameters

- `DConstVal`: Constant
- `DX`: Coefficient of the X term
- `DY`: Coefficient of the Y term
- `DXY`: Coefficient of the XY term
- `DX2`: Coefficient of the X

2

term
- `DY2`: Coefficient of the Y

.

## Remarks

This property is valid only if[ICWForce::IncludeNonUniformDistribution2](SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks~SolidWorks.Interop.cosworks.ICWForce~IncludeNonUniformDistribution2.html)is set to -1 or true.

See the SOLIDWORKS Simulation user-interface help for details about nonuniform force distribution.
