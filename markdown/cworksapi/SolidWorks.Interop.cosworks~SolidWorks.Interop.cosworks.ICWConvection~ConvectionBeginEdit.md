# ConvectionBeginEdit Method (ICWConvection)

Starts editing convection.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub ConvectionBeginEdit()
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICWConvection

instance.ConvectionBeginEdit()
```

### C#

```csharp
void ConvectionBeginEdit()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void ConvectionBeginEdit();
```

## VBA Syntax

See

[CWConvection::ConvectionBeginEdit](ms-its:cworksapivb6.chm::/CosmosWorksLib~CWConvection~ConvectionBeginEdit.html)

.

## Examples

[Apply Thermostat-controlled Heat Power with Transient Thermal Study (VBA)](Apply_Thermostat-controlled_Heat_Power_for_Transient_Thermal_Study_Example_VB.htm)

## Remarks

To start editing convection, you must call this method. You must call[ICWConvection::ConvectionEndEdit](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.cosworks.ICWConvection~ConvectionEndEdit.html)to end editing that convection. Changes are not applied unless you call both methods.
