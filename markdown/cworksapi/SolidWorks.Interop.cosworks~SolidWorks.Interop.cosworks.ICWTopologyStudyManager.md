## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Public Interface ICWTopologyStudyManager
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICWTopologyStudyManager
```

### C#

public interface ICWTopologyStudyManager
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
public interface class ICWTopologyStudyManager
```

## VBA Syntax

See

.

## Examples

[Create Topology Study (VBA)](Create_Topology_Study_Example_VB.htm)

## Remarks

A topology study:

- seeks to optimize the material layout of parts by redistributing material, subject to all applied loads, fixtures, and manufacturing constraints.
- consists of optimization goals, constraints, preserved regions, and manufacturing controls. A topology constraint defines, for example, how much material to remove (mass constraint) or how far to displace a component (displacement constraint) to satisfy a given topology optimization goal (e.g., minimize maximum displacement).
- is available with SOLIDWORKS Simulation Professional and Premium licenses only.

See the**Topology Study**topic in the Simulation user-interface help for more information.
