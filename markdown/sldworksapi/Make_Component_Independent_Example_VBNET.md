# Make Component Independent Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to:

- make a selected component
  independent.
- save the selected component
  as a new part.
- reference the new part in
  the assembly.

```
'------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Verify that c:\temp exists.
' 2. Copy these files from public_documents\samples\tutorial\driveworksxpress
'    to c:\temp:
'    * leg.sldprt
'    * mobile gantry.sldasm
'    * universal beam.sldpart
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Opens the assembly.
' 2. Selects the leg<1> component.
' 3. Makes the selected component independent, saves the component as
'    a new part, c:\temp\my leg.sldprt, and references the new part in
'    the assembly.
' 4. Examine the FeatureManager design tree and c:\temp.
