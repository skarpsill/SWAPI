# Link Projected View to Parent Configuration Example (VBA)

This example shows how to link a projected drawing view to the parent
configuration.

```
'-------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Verify that the specified file exists.
' 2. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Links the projected view to the parent configuration.
' 2. Examine the Immediate window.
'
' NOTE: Because this drawing document is used elsewhere, do not save
' changes.

```

```
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks
Dim swModel As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
Dim swModelDocExt As SldWorks.ModelDocExtension

Dim swView As SldWorks.View
Dim fileName As String
Dim errors As Long
Dim warnings As Long
Dim status As Boolean
```

```

Set swDrawing = swModel
Set swModelDocExt = swModel.Extension

```
' Make the projected view the active view

 Set swView = swDrawing.ActiveDrawingView
```

```
' Determine whether the projected view is linked to the
' parent configuration
Call LinkConfiguration
```

' Link the projected view to the parent
' configuration
