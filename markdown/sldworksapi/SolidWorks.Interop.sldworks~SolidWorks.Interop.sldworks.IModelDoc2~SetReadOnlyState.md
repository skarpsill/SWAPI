.

### Parameters

## VBA Syntax

See

[ModelDoc2::SetReadOnlyState](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~ModelDoc2~SetReadOnlyState.html)

.

## Remarks

If the file is opened as read-write, specifying read-only should work except if it is a new file that has not yet been saved.

If the file is opened as read-only in SOLIDWORKS, then specifying read-write only changes the internal SOLIDWORKS state (not the access rights on disk) and only succeeds if it would be possible to open this file with write access. If the file is read-only on disk or if another user has it open with write access, then this method does not change the internal state to writeable; the document remains read-only.
