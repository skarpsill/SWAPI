## Remarks

This method operates on the features that are selected before this method executes.

The Type argument indicates whether the folder that is created:

- Contains the preselected features.

- or -

- Is empty and placed relative to the preselected features.kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}

(Table)=========================================================

| If creating... | Then... |
| --- | --- |
| A folder to contain the preselected features | Certain types of features cannot be moved into that folder, such as the predefined planes that exist when a new part is created. These types of features are ignored by this method. If multiple features are selected when this method runs, all of the features are moved into the new folder; however, these features must be consecutive. If they are not, only the first group of consecutive features are moved into the new folder. |
| An empty folder | The folder is created just before the first valid feature in the selections. The new folder cannot be placed before certain features, such as the predefined planes that exist when a new part is created. |

kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}

Because a folder cannot be created inside another folder, any selected features already inside a folder are ignored.

This method works with components and features.
