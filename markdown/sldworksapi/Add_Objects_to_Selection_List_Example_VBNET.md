# Add Objects to Selection List Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to populate the selection list with objects that have
not been pre-selected through the user interface.

```vb
  '----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ' Preconditions:
  ' 1. Open Public_documents\SOLIDWORKS\SOLIDWORKS 2020\samples\tutorial\api\multi_local.sldprt.
  ' 2. Open the Immediate window.
  '
  ' Postconditions:
  ' 1. Suspends the selection list containing Sketch2.
  ' 2. Populates another selection list with six sketch objects.
  ' 3. Gets the type of the last object in the selection list.
  ' 4. Appends the last selection list of six objects to the previously suspended
  '       selection list that contains Sketch2, placing Sketch2 at the top of the
  '       combined and resumed selection list.
  ' 5. Places Sketch2 in edit mode.
  ' 6. Inspect the Immediate window and graphics area.
  ' 7. Discard changes to the model.
  '
  ' NOTE: Because the model is used elsewhere, do not save any changes.
