# SetWallThickness Method (IRevolveFeatureData2)

Sets the wall thickness of the thin revolution feature in forward/reverse direction.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub SetWallThickness( _
   ByVal Forward As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal WallThickness As System.Double _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IRevolveFeatureData2
Dim Forward As System.Boolean
Dim WallThickness As System.Double

instance.SetWallThickness(Forward, WallThickness)
```

### C#

```csharp
void SetWallThickness(
   System.bool Forward,
   System.double WallThickness
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void SetWallThickness(
   System.bool Forward,
   System.double WallThickness
)
```
