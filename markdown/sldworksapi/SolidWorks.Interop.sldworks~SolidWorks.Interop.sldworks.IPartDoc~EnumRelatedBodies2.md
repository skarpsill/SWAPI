# EnumRelatedBodies2 Method (IPartDoc)

Creates an enumerated list of bodies.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function EnumRelatedBodies2() As EnumBodies2
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IPartDoc
Dim value As EnumBodies2

value = instance.EnumRelatedBodies2()
```

### C#

```csharp
EnumBodies2 EnumRelatedBodies2()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
EnumBodies2^ EnumRelatedBodies2();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

[Enumerated list of bodies](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IEnumBodies2.html)

## VBA Syntax

See

[PartDoc::EnumRelatedBodies2](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~PartDoc~EnumRelatedBodies2.html)

.

## Remarks

The list contains only those bodies associated with reference surfaces. The list does not include the part body itself.

A reference surface feature can consist of one or more surfaces sewn together. Each reference surface feature has two[IBody2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IBody2.html)objects:

- One represents the front face or faces
- Onekadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}represents the back face or faces

Each IBody2 object has one or more faces depending on whether the reference surface feature is a set of knitted surfaces or a single underlying surface. The corresponding faces for each body pair should have normal vectors that are opposite.

To use the enumerated list, see[IEnumBodies2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IEnumBodies2.html)functions.
