## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetFaceTangentTo( _
   ByVal Index As System.Integer _
) As Face2
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData
Dim Index As System.Integer
Dim value As Face2

value = instance.GetFaceTangentTo(Index)
```

### C#

```csharp
Face2 GetFaceTangentTo(
   System.int Index
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Face2^ GetFaceTangentTo(
   System.int Index
)
```
