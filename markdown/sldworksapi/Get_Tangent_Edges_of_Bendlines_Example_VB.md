# Get Tangent Edges of Bendlines Example (VBA)

This example shows how to get each bendline's visible tangent edges
in a flat-pattern view in a drawing of a sheet metal part.

```
'---------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open a SOLIDWORKS drawing of a sheet metal part
'    that has a flat-pattern view with
'    bend lines with tangent edges.
' 2. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Preconditions: Examine the Immediate window.
