Dim Count As System.Integer
Dim Entities As System.Object

instance.ISetSelections(Count, Entities)
```

### C#

```csharp
void ISetSelections(
   System.int Count,
   ref System.object Entities
)
```

## Remarks

See[Accessing Selections that Define Features](sldworksAPIProgGuide.chm::/Miscellaneous/Accessing_Selections_that_Define_Features.htm)for additional details on using this method.

**IMPORTANT:**Reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2010 or later are constraint based; reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2009 or earlier are not. See the**Remarks**section in the[IRefPlaneFeatureData interface](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IRefPlaneFeatureData.html)topic for details about reference planes and this interface.
