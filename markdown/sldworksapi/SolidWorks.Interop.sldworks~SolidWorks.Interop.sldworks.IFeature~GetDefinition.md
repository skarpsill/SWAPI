# GetDefinition Method (IFeature)

Gets the feature data object for a feature, such as an advanced mate, extrusion, loft, fillet, chamfer, etc., in order to access the parameters that control the definition of this feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetDefinition() As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeature
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.GetDefinition()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object GetDefinition()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ GetDefinition();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

Feature data object (see**Remarks**)

## VBA Syntax

See

[Feature::GetDefinition](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Feature~GetDefinition.html)

## Remarks

You can use this method to query the feature data object, and you can modify the feature data object using[IFeature::ModifyDefinition](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html). Set the feature data object to Nothing or null when it is no longer needed. Not all feature types are supported, so check to see that the returned object is valid.

To:

- get the type of feature and the name of its associated interface, use

  [IFeature::GetTypeName](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetTypeName.html)

  or

  [IFeature::GetTypeName2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetTypeName2.html)

  .
- see a complete list of interfaces for feature data objects (e.g., interfaces ending in FeatureData or FeatureData2, such as ISymmetricMateFeatureData, IExtrudeFeatureData2, ILoftFeatureData, ISimpleFilletFeatureData2, IChamferFeatureData2, etc.), see the

  Features Interfaces

  and

  Assembly Interfaces - Mates

  sections in

  [Functional Categories](FunctionalCategories-sldworksapi.html)

  .
- get the object of a feature that is not a feature data object, use

  [IFeature::GetSpecificFeature2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetSpecificFeature2.html)

  .
