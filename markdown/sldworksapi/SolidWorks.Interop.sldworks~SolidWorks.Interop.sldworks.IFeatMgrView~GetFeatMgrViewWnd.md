.

## VBA Syntax

See

[FeatMgrView::GetFeatMgrViewWnd](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~FeatMgrView~GetFeatMgrViewWnd.html)

.

## Remarks

If your application must be x64 compatible, then use[IFeatMgrView::GetFeatMgrViewWndx64](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeatMgrView~GetFeatMgrViewWndx64.html).

You can use this CWnd in combination with standard MFC calls to draw into this view.

Call this method when the FeatureManager design tree is created with[IModelViewManager::CreateFeatureMgrView2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelViewManager~CreateFeatureMgrView2.html). You do not need to call this method with[IModelDoc2::AddFeatureMgrView3](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~AddFeatureMgrView3.html), because you created the view and already have its handle.
