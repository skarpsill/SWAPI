# Get Temporary Axis and Its Reference Face Example (VBA)

This example shows how to get a temporary axis and its reference
face.

```
'---------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open public_documents\samples\tutorial\api\box.sldprt.
' 2. Click View > Hide/Show > Temporary Axes.
' 3. Select the temporary axis.
' 4. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Gets whether the selected entity is a temporary
'    axis.
' 2. Gets the reference face of the temporary axis.
' 3. Examine the Immediate window and graphics area.
'
' NOTE: Because the part is used elsewhere, do not save
' changes.
