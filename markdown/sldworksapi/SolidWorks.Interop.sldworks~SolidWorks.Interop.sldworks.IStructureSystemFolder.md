## Remarks

This interface accesses the top-level folder of a structure system in the FeatureManager design tree. The structure system folder contains one or more profile group folders. Each profile group folder contains profile references and structure system members.

When a structure system is created in the user interface, the Corner Management PropertyManager opens automatically. When structure systems are created using the API, a Corner Management`X`folder is automatically created for each structure system in the FeatureManager design tree.

A structure system and its corner management folder appears similar to the following in the FeatureManager design tree. In parentheses are the APIs that you use to access the corresponding item:

-**Structure System1**(IStructureSystemFolder accessors)

-**Structure System Grid1**

-**<ansi inch> <c channel><3 x 5> (1)**([IProfileGroupFolder](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IProfileGroupFolder.html)accessors)

-**Plane2**(profile reference plane -[IProfileGroupFolder::GetPlane](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IProfileGroupFolder~GetPlane.html))

-**Sketch11**(profile sketch -[IProfileGroupFolder::GetSketch](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IProfileGroupFolder~GetSketch.html))

-**Member1**(structure system member -[IProfileGroupFolder::GetStructureSystemMembers](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IProfileGroupFolder~GetStructureSystemMembers.html))

-**Corner Management1**([ICornerManagementFolder](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ICornerManagementFolder.html)accessors)

-**Complex Corner Group1**([ICornerTreatmentGroupFolder](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ICornerTreatmentGroupFolder.html)accessors)

-**Corner5**([ICornerTreatmentFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ICornerTreatmentFeatureData.html)accessors and then cast to[IComplexCornerTreatmentFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IComplexCornerTreatmentFeatureData.html))

- more corners...

(Each corner in a complex corner group contains multiple corner members. If you edit a corner to open a Corner Management PropertyManager in the user interface, on the Complex tab are three boxes that list corner members for Trim Tool, Body Trim, and Planar Trim. Use[ICornerMember](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ICornerMember.html)to access these corner members.)

-**Two member Corner Group1**(ICornerTreatmentGroupFolder accessors)

-**Corner1**(ICornerTreatmentFeatureData accessors and then cast to[ITwoMemberCornerTreatmentFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ITwoMemberCornerTreatmentFeatureData.html))

- more corners...

(Each corner in a two member corner group contains two corner members, one for Trim Tool, and one for Body Trim. Use ICornerMember to access these corner members.)

-**Simple Corner Group1**(ICornerTreatmentGroupFolder accessors)

-**Corner9**(ICornerTreatmentFeatureData accessors and then cast to[ISimpleCornerTreatmentFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISimpleCornerTreatmentFeatureData.html))

To create a structure system:

1. Create an

  [IStructureSystemMemberFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IStructureSystemMemberFeatureData.html)

  object for every primary and secondary structure system member you intend to create.
2. Create

  [IStructureSystemSplitMember](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IStructureSystemSplitMember.html)

  objects as needed. Use

  [IStructureSystemMemberFeatureData::IsSplit](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IStructureSystemMemberFeatureData~IsSplit.html)

  to indicate that split members exist.
3. Create one or more

  [IStructureSystemMemberProfile](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IStructureSystemMemberProfile.html)

  objects as the number of different profiles is needed.
4. Cast the IStructureSystemMemberFeatureData objects to

  [IPrimaryStructuralMemberFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IPrimaryStructuralMemberFeatureData.html)

  objects and

  [ISecondaryStructuralMemberFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISecondaryStructuralMemberFeatureData.html)

  objects as needed.
5. Create specific primary member feature data objects by casting IPrimaryStructuralMemberFeatureData objects to:

  -

  [IPrimaryMemberFacePlaneIntersectionFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IPrimaryMemberFacePlaneIntersectionFeatureData.html)

  -

  [IPrimaryMemberPathSegmentFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IPrimaryMemberPathSegmentFeatureData.html)

  -

  [IPrimaryMemberPointLengthFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IPrimaryMemberPointLengthFeatureData.html)

  -

  [IPrimaryMemberRefPlaneFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IPrimaryMemberRefPlaneFeatureData.html)
6. Create specific secondary member feature data objects by casting ISecondaryStructuralMemberFeatureData objects to:

  -

  [ISecondaryMemberBetweenPointsFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISecondaryMemberBetweenPointsFeatureData.html)

  -

  [ISecondaryMemberSupportPlaneFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISecondaryMemberSupportPlaneFeatureData.html)
7. Use the methods and properties on the specific primary and secondary member feature data objects to detail the structure system members.
8. Call

  [IModelDocExtension::CreateStructureSystem](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~CreateStructureSystem.html)

  (

  primaryFDArray

  ,

  secondaryFDArray

  ), where

  primaryFDArray

  is an array of primary IStructureSystemMemberFeatureData objects and

  secondaryFDArray

  is an array of secondary IStructureSystemMemberFeatureData objects created in step 1.

To edit a structure system:

1. Get the structure system folder feature, which is returned by IModelDocExtension::CreateStructureSystem in step 8 above. Then call the accessor of this interface, IFeature::GetSpecificFeature2.

  (Or call both accessors of this interface.)
2. Use

  [IStructureSystemFolder::GetProfileGroupFolders](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IStructureSystemFolder~GetProfileGroupFolders.html)

  to access the profile group folders in a structure system folder.
3. Use IProfileGroupFolder methods and properties to get the sketch, reference plane, and structure system members in each profile group folder.
4. Use

  [IStructureSystemMemberFeatureData::StructureSystemMemberType](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IStructureSystemMemberFeatureData~StructureSystemMemberType.html)

  to determine whether a structure system member retrieved in step 3 is a primary or a secondary member.
5. Call

  [IStructureSystemMemberFeatureData::AccessSelections](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IStructureSystemMemberFeatureData~AccessSelections.html)

  before editing the selections used to create the structure system. Call

  [IStructureSystemMemberFeatureData::ReleaseSelectionAccess](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IStructureSystemMemberFeatureData~ReleaseSelectionAccess.html)

  after editing.
6. Cast IStructureSystemMemberFeatureData objects to their subclass feature data objects (see create steps 5 and 6).
7. If you need to change a structure member's profile, use

  [IStructureSystemMemberFeatureData::MemberProfile](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IStructureSystemMemberFeatureData~MemberProfile.html)

  to get the IStructureSystemMemberProfile object for each structure member.
8. Complete the structure system edit by calling

  [IStructureSystemMemberFeatureData::GetFeature](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IStructureSystemMemberFeatureData~GetFeature.html)

  , calling methods and properties on objects retrieved in previous steps as required, and finally calling

  [IFeature::ModifyDefinition](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html)

  .

Use the examples as models to create and edit structure sytems in your own applications.
