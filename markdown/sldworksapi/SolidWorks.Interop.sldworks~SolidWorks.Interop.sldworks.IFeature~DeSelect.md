Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.DeSelect()

```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

True if the feature is deselected successfully, false if not

## VBA Syntax

See

[Feature::DeSelect](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Feature~DeSelect.html)

.

## Examples

[Get Section Properties for Faces from Section Planes (VBA)](Get_Section_Properties_Example_VB.htm)

## Remarks

Use

[IModelDoc2::DeSelectByID](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~DeSelectByID.html)

instead of this method. This method does not work well when a PropertyManager page is open or a command is running. IModelDoc2::DeSelectByID handles selection correctly whether or not a command is running.
