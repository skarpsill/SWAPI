Dim instance As IBody2
Dim value As Surface

value = instance.ICreateNewSurface()

## Remarks

This method is the first in a set of related functions that construct a body from trimmed surfaces. Internally, this function also creates a list that SOLIDWORKS uses as a place-holder for trimming curves used to trim the surface to the desired shape.

Any existing object created by this method is destroyed if you call this method again.
