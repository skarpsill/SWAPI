Dim instance As ISweepFeatureData
Dim Forward As System.Boolean
Dim value As System.Double

value = instance.GetWallThickness(Forward)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.double GetWallThickness(
   System.bool Forward
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.double GetWallThickness(
   System.bool Forward
)
```
