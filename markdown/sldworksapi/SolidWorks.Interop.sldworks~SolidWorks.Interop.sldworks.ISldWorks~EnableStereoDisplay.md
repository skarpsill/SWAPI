# EnableStereoDisplay Method (ISldWorks)

Obsolete and not superseded. Functionality no longer implemented.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function EnableStereoDisplay( _
   ByVal BEnable As System.Boolean _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISldWorks
Dim BEnable As System.Boolean
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.EnableStereoDisplay(BEnable)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool EnableStereoDisplay(
   System.bool BEnable
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool EnableStereoDisplay(
   System.bool BEnable
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `BEnable`: Bitfield flags that control the application's stereo support status

### Return Value

True if stereo attribute setting was successful, false if not

## VBA Syntax

See

[SldWorks::EnableStereoDisplay](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~SldWorks~EnableStereoDisplay.html)

.

## Remarks

You must select theEnable Quadbuffered Stereo APIcheck box for NVIDIA Quadro4 OpenGL video cards before opening any windows.

Calling this methodwith bit #0, the low bit, of the flags field set (flags |= 0x01) sets up all subsequently opened document windows to be capable of displaying stereo; already opened document windows are not affected. If this method is not called, or if it is called with the low bit of flagscleared, the document windows are not be capable of displaying stereo.

Bit #1 controls whether or not3D scenes are displayed to separate left-eye and right-eye stereoscopic buffers. If bit #1 of the flagsfield is set (flags |= 0x02), separately buffered stereo pairs are rendered for all windows with 3D scenes that are capable of displaying stereo.

Thus, any plug-in that might need to display stereoscopically should, upon loading, immediately call this method, with the flags field set to 0x01. To actually activate stereo display, call this method with the flags field set to 0x03. To deactivate stereo display, call this method with the flags field set to 0x01. Finally, just before the plug-in uninstalls, restore SOLIDWORKS' default behavior by calling this method with the flags field set to 0x00.

For the stereo pair renderings to appear stereoscopic, call[IModelView::SetStereoSeparation](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelView~SetStereoSeparation.html)or[IModelView::ISetStereoSeparation](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelView~ISetStereoSeparation.html). By default, the stereo rendering-control attributes that are set by IModelView::SetStereoSeparation or IModelView::ISetStereoSeparationare set for identical left-eye and right-eye renderings.
