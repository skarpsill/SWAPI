## Remarks

All of the centerlines for a drawing view are stored on a sketch. This method returns that sketch. You can get information about the sketch entities, including the centerlines, in the sketch.

This method allows you to access properties of individual centerlines. DXF translation may use this method to get the centerline information in a SOLIDWORKS drawing.
