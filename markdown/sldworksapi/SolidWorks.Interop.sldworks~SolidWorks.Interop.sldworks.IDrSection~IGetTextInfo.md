.

  Remarks

  )

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

## Remarks

The section line in a drawing view usually has a piece of text near each end of the line, typically the section view label ([IDrSection::GetLabel](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IDrSection~GetLabel.html)). The array returned by this method consists of 6 doubles, the (X, Y, Z) origin of one text followed by the (X, Y, Z) origin of the other text. The origin is the upper-left corner of the text.

These values are the same as some of the information in the array returned by[IView::IGetSectionLineInfo2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IView~IGetSectionLineInfo2.html). The text information in that array also contains the text height. This method returns an array that does not include that information, but you can get it using[IDrSection::IGetTextFormat](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IDrSection~IGetTextFormat.html)and[ITextFormat::CharHeight](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ITextFormat~CharHeight.html).
