```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Size`: Size of an array of doubles to allocate in call to

[IView::GetBreakLineInfo](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IView~GetBreakLineInfo.html)

and

[IView::IGetBreakLineInfo](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IView~IGetBreakLineInfo.html)

### Return Value

Number of breaks

## VBA Syntax

See

[View::GetBreakLineCount](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~View~GetBreakLineCount.html)

.

## Remarks

This method indicates the number of break lines in the view; it does not indicate if the view is broken.

A drawing view can have break lines without the break being applied. To determine whether a view is broken, use[IView::IsBroken](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IView~IsBroken.html).

A break in a drawing view consists of a pair of lines. This method returns the number of breaks in the view, not the number of break lines. For example, this method returns 3 for a view that has three breaks in it, even though there are three pairs (or six lines) on the display.

Call this method before calling[IView::IGetBreakLines](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IView~IGetBreakLines.html)to determine the size of the array for that method.
