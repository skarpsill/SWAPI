# AccessSelections Method (ISurfaceCutFeatureData)

Accesses the selections that define this surface-cut feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function AccessSelections( _
   ByVal TopDoc As System.Object, _
   ByVal Component As System.Object _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISurfaceCutFeatureData
Dim TopDoc As System.Object
Dim Component As System.Object
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.AccessSelections(TopDoc, Component)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool AccessSelections(
   System.object TopDoc,
   System.object Component
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool AccessSelections(
   System.Object^ TopDoc,
   System.Object^ Component
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `TopDoc`: Top-level document
- `Component`: Component in which the surface-cut feature is to be modified

### Return Value

True if successful, false if not

## Remarks

To access this interface, you must declare it as SurfCutFeatureData or ISurfCutFeatureData. See the examples for details.

This method puts the model into a rollback state to allow access to the selections that define this feature. You must use either of the following methods to restore the rollback state:

- [IFeature::ModifyDefinition](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html)

  or

  [IFeature::IModifyDefinition2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~IModifyDefinition2.html)

  if you modified the feature
- [ISurfaceCutFeatureData::ReleaseSelectionAccess](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISurfaceCutFeatureData~ReleaseSelectionAccess.html)

  if you did not
