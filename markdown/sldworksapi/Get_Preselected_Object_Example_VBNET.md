# Get Preselected Object Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to get a preselected object when a preselection
event is fired.

```
'------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open a part, assembly, or drawing.
' 2. Click Tools > Options > System Options > top VSTA debugger
'    on macro exit if the check box is selected.
' 3. If a part or assembly document is active, then
'    preselect (mouse over) a face.
'    - or -
'    If a drawing document is active, then preselect
'    an edge.
' 4. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. When a face is preselected in a part or assembly
'    document, or an edge is pre-selected in a drawing document,
'    then that interface's UserSelectionPreNotify event is fired.
' 2. To stop running the macro, click Debug > Stop Debugging
'    in the SolidWorks Visual Studio Tools for Applications IDE.
' 3. Examine the Immediate window.
' 4. Click Tools > Options > System Options > Stop VSTA debugger
'    on macro exit to select the check box.
