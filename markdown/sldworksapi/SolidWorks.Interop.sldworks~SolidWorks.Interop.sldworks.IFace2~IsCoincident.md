   ByVal Tolerance As System.Double _
) As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFace2
Dim FaceIn As System.Object
Dim Tolerance As System.Double
Dim value As System.Integer

value = instance.IsCoincident(FaceIn, Tolerance)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int IsCoincident(
   System.object FaceIn,
   System.double Tolerance
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.int IsCoincident(
   System.Object^ FaceIn,
   System.double Tolerance
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `FaceIn`: [Face](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFace2.html)

located on a different body
- `Tolerance`: Tolerance

### Return Value

Result as defined in

[swFaceCoincidentResult_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swFaceCoincidentResult_e.html)

(see

Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

See

[Face2::IsCoincident](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Face2~IsCoincident.html)

.

## Remarks

For two faces to be considered coincident, they must have similar corresponding loops and all points on one face must be within the specified tolerance of the other face, and vice versa.
