# Get3 Method (ICustomPropertyManager)

Obsolete. Superseded by

[ICustomPropertyManager::Get4](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ICustomPropertyManager~Get4.html)

.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function Get3( _
   ByVal FieldName As System.String, _
   ByVal UseCached As System.Boolean, _
   ByRef ValOut As System.String, _
   ByRef ResolvedValOut As System.String _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICustomPropertyManager
Dim FieldName As System.String
Dim UseCached As System.Boolean
Dim ValOut As System.String
Dim ResolvedValOut As System.String
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.Get3(FieldName, UseCached, ValOut, ResolvedValOut)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool Get3(
   System.string FieldName,
   System.bool UseCached,
   out System.string ValOut,
   out System.string ResolvedValOut
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool Get3(
   System.String^ FieldName,
   System.bool UseCached,
   [Out] System.String^ ValOut,
   [Out] System.String^ ResolvedValOut
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `FieldName`: Name of the custom property
- `UseCached`: True if configuration has been activated, false if not (see

Remarks

)
- `ValOut`: Value of the custom property
- `ResolvedValOut`: Evaluated value of the custom property

### Return Value

True if up-to-date data is returned, false if not (see

Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

See

[CustomPropertyManager::Get3](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~CustomPropertyManager~Get3.html)

.

## Remarks

This method can get the cached custom property, even if the configuration is not currently active, without having to change configurations.

(Table)=========================================================

| If UseCached is set to... | And the configuration has already been activated... | Then... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| True | Yes | Up-to-date data is returned and return value = True |
| True | No | Cached data is returned and return value = False |
| False | Yes | Up-to-date data is returned and return value = True |
| False | No | Up-to-date data is returned and return value = True |

kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}This method returns configuration-specific, linked, custom-property, evaluated data more quickly than the now obsolete[ICustomPropertyManager::Get2 method](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ICustomPropertyManager~Get2.html), if the configuration was previously activated.

If you always want up-to-date data, then you should set UseCached to false. This may result in a more time-consuming call if the configuration was not previously activated.
