# IFeatureFillet Method (IFeatureManager)

Obsolete. Superseded by

[IFeatureManager::IFeatureFillet2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~IFeatureFillet2.html)

.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IFeatureFillet( _
   ByVal Options As System.Integer, _
   ByVal R1 As System.Double, _
   ByVal Ftyp As System.Integer, _
   ByVal OverflowType As System.Integer, _
   ByVal NRadii As System.Integer, _
   ByRef Radii As System.Double, _
   ByVal SetbackDistCount As System.Integer, _
   ByRef SetBackDistances As System.Double, _
   ByVal PointCount As System.Integer, _
   ByRef PointRadiusArray As System.Double _
) As Feature
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeatureManager
Dim Options As System.Integer
Dim R1 As System.Double
Dim Ftyp As System.Integer
Dim OverflowType As System.Integer
Dim NRadii As System.Integer
Dim Radii As System.Double
Dim SetbackDistCount As System.Integer
Dim SetBackDistances As System.Double
Dim PointCount As System.Integer
Dim PointRadiusArray As System.Double
Dim value As Feature

value = instance.IFeatureFillet(Options, R1, Ftyp, OverflowType, NRadii, Radii, SetbackDistCount, SetBackDistances, PointCount, PointRadiusArray)
```

### C#

```csharp
Feature IFeatureFillet(
   System.int Options,
   System.double R1,
   System.int Ftyp,
   System.int OverflowType,
   System.int NRadii,
   ref System.double Radii,
   System.int SetbackDistCount,
   ref System.double SetBackDistances,
   System.int PointCount,
   ref System.double PointRadiusArray
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Feature^ IFeatureFillet(
   System.int Options,
   System.double R1,
   System.int Ftyp,
   System.int OverflowType,
   System.int NRadii,
   System.double% Radii,
   System.int SetbackDistCount,
   System.double% SetBackDistances,
   System.int PointCount,
   System.double% PointRadiusArray
)
```

[swFeatureFilletType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swFeatureFilletType_e.html)
- `OverflowType`: Control of fillet overflowing onto adjacent surfaces as defined in

[swFilletOverFlowType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swFilletOverFlowType_e.html)
- `NRadii`: Number of radii for variable radius fillet
- `Radii`: - in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of doubles containing the radii for the variable radius fillet
- VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.
- `SetbackDistCount`: Number of setback distances for the fillet along the edge
- `SetBackDistances`: - in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of doubles containing setback distances for the fillet along the edge of size SetbackDistCount
- VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.
- `PointCount`: Number of control point radii at various points along the length of the edge
- `PointRadiusArray`: - in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of doubles containing the control point radii of size PointCount
- VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.
