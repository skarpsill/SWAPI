' Preconditions:
' 1. Copy and paste Main into your project.
' 2. Insert a class module and copy and paste Class1 into that module.
' 3. Open public_documents\samples\tutorial\EDraw\claw\center.sldprt.
' 4. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Renames center to centerXXX.
' 2. Fires the PreRenameItemNotify and RenameItemNotify events.
' 3. Examine the FeatureManager design tree and Immediate window.
