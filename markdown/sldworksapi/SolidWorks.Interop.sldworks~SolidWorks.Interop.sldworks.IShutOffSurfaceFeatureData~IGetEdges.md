# IGetEdges Method (IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData)

Gets the edges that form closed loops to use for the patches.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetEdges( _
   ByVal Count As System.Integer _
) As Edge
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData
Dim Count As System.Integer
Dim value As Edge

value = instance.IGetEdges(Count)
```

### C#

```csharp
Edge IGetEdges(
   System.int Count
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Edge^ IGetEdges(
   System.int Count
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Count`: Number of edges that form loops

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of

  [edges](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IEdge.html)

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

## Remarks

Call[IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData::GetLoopCount](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData~GetLoopCount.html)before calling this method to get the value for Count.

See[Accessing Selections that Define Features](sldworksAPIProgGuide.chm::/Miscellaneous/Accessing_Selections_that_Define_Features.htm)for additional details.
