## Remarks

The name of a column corresponds to the dimension name and feature name, separated by an @ symbol; e.g.,**D3@Fillet1**.

There are various ways of getting the name of the column of dimensions to delete from a pattern table. For example, you can traverse the features, get the dimensions, and get the names of the dimensions. You can also select a dimension and get its name. See the examples for details.

**NOTE:**You cannot delete a column containing the dimensions of a parent sketch or feature.
