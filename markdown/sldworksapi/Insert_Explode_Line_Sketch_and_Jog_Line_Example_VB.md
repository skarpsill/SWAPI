# Insert Explode Line Sketch and Jog Line Example (VBA)

This example shows how to insert a jog line in an explode line sketch,
a type of 3D sketch.

```
'--------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions: Open public_documents\samples\tutorial\floxpress\ball valve\ball_valve.sldasm.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Creates an exploded view of the assembly.
' 2. Adds a jog line, which is a type of explode line.
' 3. Examine the graphics area.
' 4. Locate 3DExplode1, the explode line sketch, on the
'    ConfigurationManager tab (click the ConfigurationManager tab and
'    expand default and ExplView1.)
'
' NOTE: Because this assembly is used elsewhere, do not save changes.
