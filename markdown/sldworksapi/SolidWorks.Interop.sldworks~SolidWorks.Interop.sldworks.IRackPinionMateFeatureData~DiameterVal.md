# DiameterVal Property (IRackPinionMateFeatureData)

Gets or sets either the pinion pitch diameter or the rack translation distance per pinion revolution.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property DiameterVal As System.Double
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IRackPinionMateFeatureData
Dim value As System.Double

instance.DiameterVal = value

value = instance.DiameterVal
```

### C#

```csharp
System.double DiameterVal {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.double DiameterVal {
   System.double get();
   void set (    System.double value);
}
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Property Value

Pinion pitch diameter or rack translation distance per pinion revolution (see

Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

See

[RackPinionMateFeatureData::DiameterVal](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~RackPinionMateFeatureData~DiameterVal.html)

.

## Examples

See the

[IRackPinionMateFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IRackPinionMateFeatureData.html)

example.

## Remarks

For each full rotation of the pinion, the rack translates a distance = (pi * pinion pitch diameter).

If[IRackPinionMateFeatureData::DiameterType](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IRackPinionMateFeatureData~DiameterType.html)is set to[swRackPinionMateDistanceOptions_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SolidWorks.Interop.swconst~SolidWorks.Interop.swconst.swRackPinionMateDistanceOptions_e.html):

- swPinionPitchDiameter, use this property to specify the pinion pitch diameter.
- swRackTravelPerRevolution, use this property to specify the rack translation distance per revolution of the pinion.
