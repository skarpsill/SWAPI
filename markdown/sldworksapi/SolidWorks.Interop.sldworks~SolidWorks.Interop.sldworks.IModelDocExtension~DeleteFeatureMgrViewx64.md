(Table)=========================================================

| If you created the FeatureManager design tree view using... | Then... |
| --- | --- |
| IModelViewManager::CreateFeatureMgrView2 | Calling IModelDocExtension::DeleteFeatureMgrViewx64 destroys the CView object used for the FeatureManager design tree view. |
| IModelDoc2::AddFeatureMgrView3 | Your application allocated the CView object and calling IModelDocExtension::DeleteFeatureMgrViewx64 does not destroy the CView object. In this case, you must destroy the CView object using the appropriate destructor. Never use the delete operator directly on the CView object. Always use one of the appropriate MFC view destructors. |
