# SetLeaderAttachmentPointAtIndex Method (IAnnotation)

Sets the specified attachment point of a leader for an annotation with the specified index.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function SetLeaderAttachmentPointAtIndex( _
   ByVal Index As System.Integer, _
   ByVal X As System.Double, _
   ByVal Y As System.Double, _
   ByVal Z As System.Double _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IAnnotation
Dim Index As System.Integer
Dim X As System.Double
Dim Y As System.Double
Dim Z As System.Double
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.SetLeaderAttachmentPointAtIndex(Index, X, Y, Z)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool SetLeaderAttachmentPointAtIndex(
   System.int Index,
   System.double X,
   System.double Y,
   System.double Z
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool SetLeaderAttachmentPointAtIndex(
   System.int Index,
   System.double X,
   System.double Y,
   System.double Z
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Index`: Index of annotation (see

Remarks

)
- `X`: x-coordinate of attachment point
- `Y`: y-coordinate of attachment point
- `Z`: z-coordinate of attachment point

### Return Value

True if leader attached successfully, false if not

## VBA Syntax

See

[Annotation::SetLeaderAttachmentPointAtIndex](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Annotation~SetLeaderAttachmentPointAtIndex.html)

.

## Examples

```
'VBA example
'Open a drawing.
'Select a view with one note annotation.
'No other annotations are present.
'If there are other annotations, modify Index in the
'method call below to point to the note annotation.
================================
Option Explicit
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks
Dim swModel As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
Dim swDrawing As SldWorks.DrawingDoc
Dim swAnnot As SldWorks.Annotation
Dim vAnnotations As Variant
Dim swView As SldWorks.View
Dim i As Integer
Dim bRet As Boolean
Dim cnt As Long
Sub main()
    Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
    Set swModel = swApp.ActiveDoc

    Set swDrawing = swModel
    Set swView = swDrawing.ActiveDrawingView

    Debug.Assert Not swView Is Nothing
    Debug.Print "Name of drawing view: " & swView.GetName2

    vAnnotations = swView.GetAnnotations

    For i = 0 To UBound(vAnnotations)
        Set swAnnot = vAnnotations(i)
        swAnnot.Select3 True, Nothing

        cnt = swAnnot.GetLeaderCount
        If cnt = 1 Then
            bRet = swAnnot.SetLeaderAttachmentPointAtIndex(0, 0.687021207260901, 0.599975917260352, 250.03275)
            If (bRet) Then
                Debug.Print "Leader attached successfully"
            End If
        End If
    Next i
End Sub
```

## Remarks

The annotation must be of a type that supports leaders. Only notes, GTols, surface finish symbols, weld symbols, datum target symbols, and block instances support leaders of any kind.
