# IAccessSelections2 Method (ILocalLinearPatternFeatureData)

Allows you to gain access to the selections that describe this linear component pattern feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IAccessSelections2( _
   ByVal TopDoc As ModelDoc2, _
   ByVal Component As Component2 _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ILocalLinearPatternFeatureData
Dim TopDoc As ModelDoc2
Dim Component As Component2
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.IAccessSelections2(TopDoc, Component)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool IAccessSelections2(
   ModelDoc2 TopDoc,
   Component2 Component
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool IAccessSelections2(
   ModelDoc2^ TopDoc,
   Component2^ Component
)
```

NOTE:

See

### Parameters

- `TopDoc`: Top-level document (see

Remarks

)
- `Component`: Component in which the feature is to be modified (see

Remarks

)

### Return Value

True if the selections were successfully accessed, false if not

## VBA Syntax

| Assembly | TopDoc is the IModelDoc2 object for the assembly Component argument is the IComponent2 object in which the feature is to be modified |

This method puts the model into a rollback state to allow access to the selections that define this feature. You must use either of the following methods to restore the rollback state:

- [IFeature::IModifyDefinition2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~IModifyDefinition2.html)

  if you modified the feature
- [ILocalLinearPatternFeatureData::ReleaseSelectionAccess](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ILocalLinearPatternFeatureData~ReleaseSelectionAccess.html)

  if you did not
