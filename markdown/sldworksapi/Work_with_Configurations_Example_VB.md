# Work with Configurations Example (VBA)

This example shows how to work with new and derived configurations.

```
'--------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open public_documents\samples\tutorial\api\2012-sm.sldprt.
' 2. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Creates two configurations, Config1 and Config1 Derived.
' 2. Gets whether each of these configurations are derived and the
'    number of children configurations for Config1.
' 3. Gets the number and names of the configurations in the part.
' 4. Examine the Immediate window.
'
' NOTE: Because the part is used elsewhere, do not save changes.
