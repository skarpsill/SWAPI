# IGetConstraintCurves Method (IFillSurfaceFeatureData)

Gets the constraint curves for this fill-surface feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetConstraintCurves( _
   ByVal Count As System.Integer, _
   ByRef TypeArr As System.Integer _
) As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFillSurfaceFeatureData
Dim Count As System.Integer
Dim TypeArr As System.Integer
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.IGetConstraintCurves(Count, TypeArr)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object IGetConstraintCurves(
   System.int Count,
   out System.int TypeArr
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ IGetConstraintCurves(
   System.int Count,
   [Out] System.int TypeArr
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Count`: Number of entities used to constrain the surface
- `TypeArr`: - in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of types of entities used to constrain the surface as defined by

  [swSelectType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swSelectType_e.html)

  ; valid entities are:

  - edges (swSelEDGES)
  - sketches (swSelSKETCHES)
- VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of entities used as constraint curves

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported
