[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

## VBA Syntax

See

[Comment::Delete](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Comment~Delete.html)

.

## Remarks

The comment to delete must not be selected in the FeatureManager design tree. Use[IModelDoc2::ClearSelection2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~ClearSelection2.html)to ensure that the comment is not currently selected.

You must rebuild the FeatureManager design tree after deleting the comment. Use[IFeatureManager::UpdateFeatureTree](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~UpdateFeatureTree.html)to perform this action.
