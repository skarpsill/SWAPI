# IGetEllipses3 Method (ISketch)

Gets all of the ellipses in the sketch.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetEllipses3( _
   ByVal ArraySize As System.Integer _
) As System.Double
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISketch
Dim ArraySize As System.Integer
Dim value As System.Double

value = instance.IGetEllipses3(ArraySize)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.double IGetEllipses3(
   System.int ArraySize
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.double IGetEllipses3(
   System.int ArraySize
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `ArraySize`: Number of ellipses in the sketch

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of doubles (see

  Remarks

  )

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

## Remarks

See[ISketch::GetSketchSegments](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketch~GetSketchSegments.html)or[ISketch::IEnumSketchSegments](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketch~IEnumSketchSegments.html)for access to individual[ISketchSegment](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchSegment.html)and[ISketchEllipse](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchEllipse.html)objects.

The return values are in an array of doubles:

[Color, LineType, LineFont, LineWidth, LayerID, LayerOverride, StartPt[3], EndPt[3], CenterPt[3], MajorPt[3], MinorPt[3],Direction ...]

where:

(Table)=========================================================

| Color : | COLORREF returned as an integer. Return value could be 0 or -1 for default color. |
| --- | --- |
| LineType : | Line type. Valid returns are defined in swLineTypes_e . A line type is a combination of a lineStyle and lineWeight. |
| LineFont : | Value is used for polyline font information. This value can be used as an input to the IDrawingDoc::GetLineFontInfo2 and IDrawinDoc::GetLineFontName2 . |
| LineWidth : | Integer value defining the line width. Valid width values as defined in swLineWeights_e . |
| LayerID: | Integer value indicating which layer holds this entity. Obtain the ILayer object by passing this integer value to ILayerMgr::GetLayerById or ILayerMgr::IGetLayerById . |
| LayerOverride: | Integer with bit flags set to determine which properties, if any, have been overridden with respect to the Layer default properties. If the bit value is set, then the specific property or properties have been overridden. The bit indicators are: color = 0x1, style = 0x2, and width = 0x4. Therefore, if LayerOverride was returned as 3, you know the color and style have been specifically set for this item and may not match the default values associated with this item's layer. |
| StartPt[3] : | Array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the ellipse start point |
| EndPt[3] : | Array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the ellipse end point. If the ellipse is closed, then this will be the same point as the StartPt. |
| CenterPt[3] : | Array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the ellipse center point. |
| MajorPt[3] : | Array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing a point on the ellipse and on the major axis. |
| MinorPt[3] : | Array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing a point on the ellipse and on the minor axis. |
| Direction : | -1 for clockwise, +1 for counterclockwise |

This set of data repeats for each ellipse in the sketch. The size of the array is (NumEllipses * 20).

To determine the number of ellipses, use[ISketch::GetEllipseCount](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketch~GetEllipseCount.html).
