## VBA Syntax

See

[Animation::Duration](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Animation~Duration.html)

.

## Remarks

[IAnimation::Speed](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IAnimation~Speed.html)affects the duration of the animation. Animation::Speed allows you
to specify whether or not to play the animation at half speed or double speed, which
halves or doubles the animation duration.

If you use Animation::Duration while an animation is playing, then you might not get
the same result as when the animation is not running.

| If you get the Animation object using... | And then use... | Then the duration... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ISimulation::Animation | Animation::Duration | Is at the normal playing speed |
| ISimulation::PlayAnimation | Animation::Duration | Might be a different value because the animation is playing and the Animation Controller speed may be set to Normal , Slow Play , or Fast Play |
