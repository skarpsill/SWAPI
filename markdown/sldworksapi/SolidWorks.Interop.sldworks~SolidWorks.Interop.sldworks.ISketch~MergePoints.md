# MergePoints Method (ISketch)

Merges sketch points within a specified distance.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function MergePoints( _
   ByVal Distance As System.Double _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISketch
Dim Distance As System.Double
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.MergePoints(Distance)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool MergePoints(
   System.double Distance
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool MergePoints(
   System.double Distance
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Distance`: Distance at which points are considered coincident

### Return Value

True if successful, false if not

## VBA Syntax

See

[Sketch::MergePoints](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Sketch~MergePoints.html)

.

## Remarks

This method requires that only one open contour exists in the sketch. To specify a distance below which points are automatically merged while creating the segments, use[ISketchRelationManager::AddRelation](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchRelationManager~AddRelation.html)or[ISketchRelationManager::IAddRelation](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchRelationManager~IAddRelation.html)and swConstraintType_COINCIDENT.
