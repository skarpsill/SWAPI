# Get Visible Drawing Components Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to get the visible drawing components in a drawing of
an assembly.

```vb
  '-------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
 ' 1. Open a drawing document of an assembly that contains Drawing View1
 '    with one or more visible components.
 ' 2. Open the Immediate window.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1. Gets the visible components and their names.
 ' 2. Examine the Immediate window.
