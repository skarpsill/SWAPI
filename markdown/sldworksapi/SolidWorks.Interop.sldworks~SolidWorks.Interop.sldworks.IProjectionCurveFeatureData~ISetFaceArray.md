# ISetFaceArray Method (IProjectionCurveFeatureData)

Sets the target faces for the projected curve.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub ISetFaceArray( _
   ByVal FaceCount As System.Integer, _
   ByRef ArrayDataIn As System.Object _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IProjectionCurveFeatureData
Dim FaceCount As System.Integer
Dim ArrayDataIn As System.Object

instance.ISetFaceArray(FaceCount, ArrayDataIn)
```

### C#

```csharp
void ISetFaceArray(
   System.int FaceCount,
   ref System.object ArrayDataIn
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void ISetFaceArray(
   System.int FaceCount,
   System.Object^% ArrayDataIn
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `FaceCount`: Number of target faces
- `ArrayDataIn`: - in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of target faces of size FaceCount

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported
