# Create Intersect Feature Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to create an intersect feature that includes only the
internal (hollow) regions between the intersecting regions.

```
'----------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions: Verify that the specified part exists.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Opens the specified part.
' 2. Selects Shell1 and Plane6.
' 3. Creates Intersect1 feature.
' 4. Examine the FeatureManager design tree.
'
' NOTE: Because the part is used elsewhere, do not save
' changes.
