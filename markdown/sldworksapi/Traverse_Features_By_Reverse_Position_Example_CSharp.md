# Traverse Features By Reverse Position Example (C#)

This example shows how to traverse backwards through the list of features in
the FeatureManager design tree. Features are obtained by their position using
IModelDoc2::FeatureByPositionReverse.

```
//-------------------------------------
// Preconditions:
// 1. A part document is open in SOLIDWORKS.
// 2. Open the Immediate window.
// 3. Run the macro.
//
// Postconditions: Examine the Immediate window for
// the position and names of the features in
// the FeatureManager design tree in reverse
// chronological order.
//--------------------------------------

            for (i = featCount; i >= 1; i += -1)
            {
                theFeature = (Feature)Part.FeatureByPositionReverse(featCount - i);
                if ((theFeature != null))
                {
                    featName = theFeature.Name;
                    Debug.Print("Feature " + i.ToString() + " is " + featName);
