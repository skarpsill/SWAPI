# ISetPointArray Method (IFreePointCurveFeatureData)

Sets the list of X, Y, Z coordinates for the points for this free-point curve.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub ISetPointArray( _
   ByVal FeatCount As System.Integer, _
   ByRef ArrayDataIn As System.Double _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFreePointCurveFeatureData
Dim FeatCount As System.Integer
Dim ArrayDataIn As System.Double

instance.ISetPointArray(FeatCount, ArrayDataIn)
```

### C#

```csharp
void ISetPointArray(
   System.int FeatCount,
   ref System.double ArrayDataIn
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void ISetPointArray(
   System.int FeatCount,
   System.double% ArrayDataIn
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `FeatCount`: Number of features
- `ArrayDataIn`: - in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of doubles containing 3 * points (see

  Remarks

  )

- VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

## Remarks

The ArrayDataIn argument is an array of doubles containing 3 * points:

[x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, ...]
