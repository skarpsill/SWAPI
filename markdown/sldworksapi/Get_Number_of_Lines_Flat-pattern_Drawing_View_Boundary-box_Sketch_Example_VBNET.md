# Get the Number of Lines in Flat-pattern Drawing View's Boundary-box Sketch (VB.NET)

This example shows how to get the number of lines in a flat-pattern drawing
view's boundary-box sketch.

```vb
'----------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
 ' 1. Open public_documents\samples\tutorial\api\SMGussetAPI.SLDPRT.
 ' 2. Create a new drawing document.
 ' 3. Select SMGussetAPI.SLDPRT in the View
 '    Palette's dropdown list box.
 ' 4. Open the Immediate window.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1. Examine the Immediate window and the drawing.
 ' 2. If necessary, drag the drawing onto the drawing sheet
 '    and zoom in on the drawing view.
 '
 ' NOTE: Because the part is used elsewhere, do not save
 ' changes.
