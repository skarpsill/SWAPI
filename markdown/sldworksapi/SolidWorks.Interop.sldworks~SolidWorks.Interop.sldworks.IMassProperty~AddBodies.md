# AddBodies Method (IMassProperty)

Uses only the specified bodies when calculating the mass properties for this model.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function AddBodies( _
   ByVal BodyListIn As System.Object _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IMassProperty
Dim BodyListIn As System.Object
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.AddBodies(BodyListIn)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool AddBodies(
   System.object BodyListIn
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool AddBodies(
   System.Object^ BodyListIn
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `BodyListIn`: Array of

[bodies](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IBody2.html)

in the model

### Return Value

True ifthe specified bodies are used for calculating mass properties, false if not

## VBA Syntax

See

[MassProperty::AddBodies](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~MassProperty~AddBodies.html)

.

## Examples

## Remarks

This method lets you select which solid bodies to use when calculating mass properties, much like a end-user selecting the bodies via the user interface.

NOTE:If a sheet (surface) body is specified, it is ignored and false is returned.

The results of the mass property calculations vary based on whether or not this method is used.kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}

(Table)=========================================================

| If this method is... | Then... |
| --- | --- |
| Called and bodies are specified | These bodies can either be from a subset of the documents body list or from temporary bodies. NOTE: Each specified body should either come from the owning document or be a temporary body. If the body does not satisfy either case, then it is not used when calculating the mass properties. |
| Not called | Mass properties' calculations include all available bodies in the document. Part . All of the solid bodies are included in the calculations. Assembly . All of the bodies in all of the components are used in the calculations. |

If the document from which the MassProperty object came is an assembly, then any body from any of the child components can be used. To obtain the body, call[IComponent2::GetBodies2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IComponent2~GetBodies2.html). Your application does not need to make a copy of the body or apply a transform to the body.
