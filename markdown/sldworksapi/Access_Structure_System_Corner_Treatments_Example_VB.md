# Access Structure System Corner Treatments Example (VBA)

This example shows how to access structure system corner treatments.

'==========================================================================================

'Preconditions:

'1. Open public_documents \samples\tutorial\weldments\weldment_box.sldprt .

'2. Open an Immediate window.

'3. Press F5.

'

'Postconditions:

'1. Creates Structure System1 .

'2. Configures its weldment profile to have <GB><round-rods><ROUND BAR 23> .

'3. Creates Corner Management1 containing:

' - Two member Corner Group1

' - Simple Corner Group1

' - Complex Corner Group1

'4. Press F5 to inspect the corner treatments.

'5. Inspect the Immediate window.

'6. Inspect the structure system and its corner management folder in the
FeatureManager design tree.
