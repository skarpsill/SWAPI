# Rebuild All Configurations Example (VBA)

To rebuild all of the configurations in a part, assembly, or drawing
document, see:

- [Forcibly
  Rebuild All Configurations Example (VBA)](Forcibly_Rebuild_All_Configurations_Example_VB.htm)
- [Get
  Active Document Dependents Example (VBA)](Get_Active_Document_Dependents_Example_VB.htm)

Also, because each drawing view on each sheet can contain a different
model and each in a different configuration, first you must find the parts
or assemblies associated with the drawing.kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}You
can then rebuild them in the usual manner. Next, you must activate each
drawing sheet and rebuild that sheet.kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}The
following example shows how to activate each sheet in a drawing document.

```
'---------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open a drawing document that has multiple
'    sheets.
' 2. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Gets the names of each drawing sheet and
'    activates that sheet.
' 2. Examine the Immediate window.

```
Sub main()
```

```
    Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks
    Dim swModel As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
    Dim swDraw As SldWorks.DrawingDoc
    Dim swSheet As SldWorks.Sheet
    Dim vSheetNameArr As Variant
    Dim vSheetName As Variant
    Dim bRet As Boolean
    Dim i As Long
```

```
    Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
    Set swModel = swApp.ActiveDoc
    Set swDraw = swModel
```

```
    Set swSheet = swDraw.GetCurrentSheet
    Debug.Print "FileName = " & swModel.GetPathName
    Debug.Print "  Current sheet = " & swSheet.GetName
    Debug.Print ""
```

```
    vSheetNameArr = swDraw.GetSheetNames
    For Each vSheetName In vSheetNameArr
        Debug.Print "  SheetName[" & i & "] = " & vSheetName
        bRet = swDraw.ActivateSheet(vSheetName): Debug.Assert bRet
    Next vSheetName
```

```
End Sub
```
