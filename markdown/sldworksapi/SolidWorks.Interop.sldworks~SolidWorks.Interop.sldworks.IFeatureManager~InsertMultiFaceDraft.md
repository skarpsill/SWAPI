# InsertMultiFaceDraft Method (IFeatureManager)

Inserts a multiface draft feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function InsertMultiFaceDraft( _
   ByVal Angle As System.Double, _
   ByVal FlipDir As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal EdgeDraft As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal PropType As System.Integer, _
   ByVal IsStepDraft As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal IsBodyDraft As System.Boolean _
) As Feature
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeatureManager
Dim Angle As System.Double
Dim FlipDir As System.Boolean
Dim EdgeDraft As System.Boolean
Dim PropType As System.Integer
Dim IsStepDraft As System.Boolean
Dim IsBodyDraft As System.Boolean
Dim value As Feature

value = instance.InsertMultiFaceDraft(Angle, FlipDir, EdgeDraft, PropType, IsStepDraft, IsBodyDraft)
```

### C#

```csharp
Feature InsertMultiFaceDraft(
   System.double Angle,
   System.bool FlipDir,
   System.bool EdgeDraft,
   System.int PropType,
   System.bool IsStepDraft,
   System.bool IsBodyDraft
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Feature^ InsertMultiFaceDraft(
   System.double Angle,
   System.bool FlipDir,
   System.bool EdgeDraft,
   System.int PropType,
   System.bool IsStepDraft,
   System.bool IsBodyDraft
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Angle`: Draft angle in radians
- `FlipDir`: True to flip the direction of the draft (the draft direction is determined by the

selected direction, which could be a planar face, a reference plane, an edge, or

two vertices; if you refer to the last argument in

[IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~SelectByID2.html)

,

then these items have a selection mark of 1; the faces to draft have a selection

mark of 2, and the draft edges have a selection mark of 4), false to not
- `EdgeDraft`: True if this is an edge draft and the user selects edges to draft, false if this

is a face draft and the user selects faces to draft (SOLIDWORKS automatically selects

the faces next to the edge to be drafted)
- `PropType`: Propagation type:

- 0 = no propagation
- 1 = propagate to the next tangent faces that share the base neutral plane; valid for edge draft or neutral plane draft
- 2 = propagate to all faces that are a neighbor of the neutral plane
- 3 = propagate to all faces that a neighbor of the neutral plane on all inner loops (for example, all faces of a pocket or a boss)
- 4 = propagate to all faces that are a neighbor of the neutral plane on the outer loop (for example, the sides of a box with the bottom face as the neutral plane)
- `IsStepDraft`: True if the draft is a step draft, false if not
- `IsBodyDraft`: True if the draft is a body draft, false if not

### Return Value

Pointer to the newly created draft

## VBA Syntax

See

[FeatureManager::InsertMultiFaceDraft](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~FeatureManager~InsertMultiFaceDraft.html)

.

## Remarks

Make the selections using

[IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~SelectByID2.html)

before calling this method.
