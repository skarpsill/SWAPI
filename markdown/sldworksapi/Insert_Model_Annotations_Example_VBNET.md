# Insert Model Annotations Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to automatically insert a model's dimensions
marked for drawings into a drawing.

```
'---------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Assembly document to open exists.
' 2. Run the macro.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. A new drawing document is opened.
' 2. A drawing view of the assembly document is created.
' 3. The dimensions in the assembly document that are marked for drawings,
'    including any duplicate dimensions, appear in the drawing view.
' 4. The dimensions in the drawing, which are annotations,
'    are selected and marked.
