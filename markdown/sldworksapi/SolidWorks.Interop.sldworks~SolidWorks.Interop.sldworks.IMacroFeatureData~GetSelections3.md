# GetSelections3 Method (IMacroFeatureData)

Gets the selected objects for the macro feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub GetSelections3( _
   ByRef Objects As System.Object, _
   ByRef ObjectTypes As System.Object, _
   ByRef SelMarks As System.Object, _
   ByRef DrViews As System.Object, _
   ByRef ComponentXForms As System.Object _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IMacroFeatureData
Dim Objects As System.Object
Dim ObjectTypes As System.Object
Dim SelMarks As System.Object
Dim DrViews As System.Object
Dim ComponentXForms As System.Object

instance.GetSelections3(Objects, ObjectTypes, SelMarks, DrViews, ComponentXForms)
```

### C#

```csharp
void GetSelections3(
   out System.object Objects,
   out System.object ObjectTypes,
   out System.object SelMarks,
   out System.object DrViews,
   out System.object ComponentXForms
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void GetSelections3(
   [Out] System.Object^ Objects,
   [Out] System.Object^ ObjectTypes,
   [Out] System.Object^ SelMarks,
   [Out] System.Object^ DrViews,
   [Out] System.Object^ ComponentXForms
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Objects`: Array of selected objects
- `ObjectTypes`: Array of selected object types as defined in[swSelectType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swSelectType_e.html)
- `SelMarks`: Array of marks for the selected objects
- `DrViews`: Array of

[drawing views](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IView.html)
- `ComponentXForms`: Array of

[transforms](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IMathTransform.html)

for the selections' components

## VBA Syntax

See

[MacroFeatureData::GetSelections3](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~MacroFeatureData~GetSelections3.html)

.

## Examples

[Cut Body in Half Using Macro Feature (VBA)](Cut_Body_in_Half_using_Macro_Feature_Example_VB.htm)

## Remarks

When a macro feature is inserted in-context and an entity on a different component is selected, you may need to know that component's transform.

If the assembly is the active document, then you can use[IEntity::GetComponent](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IEntity~GetComponent.html)or[IComponent2::Transform2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IComponent2~Transform2.html)to get the component's transform.

However, if the part for the component is open for editing and a[macro feature is being edited](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/Macro_Features/Edit_Definition_Function.htm), then you must use Ikadov_tag{{</spaces>}}MacroFeatureData::GetSelections3 to get the component's transform. This method returns the transform and the selection. If the selection belongs to the same part as the macro feature, then NULL is returned. See also[Macro Features and Component Transforms](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/Macro_Features/Macro_Features_and_Component_Transforms.htm).

See[Accessing Selections that Define Features](sldworksAPIProgGuide.chm::/Miscellaneous/Accessing_Selections_that_Define_Features.htm)for additional details on using this method.
