# Fire Notification After Adding a Mate Example (VBA)

This example shows how to fire a post-notify event when adding mates:

```
'----------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Verify that the specified assembly to open exists.
' 2. Copy Main to the main module.
' 3. Click Insert > Class Module and copy Class to that
'    module.
' 4. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Opens the assembly.
' 2. Interactively add a mate between two entities
'    (click Insert > Mate). For example, add a lock mate
'    between the toaster base and the cup.
' 3. Adds a mate between the selected entities.
' 4. Examine the Immediate window.
'
' NOTE: Because this assembly is used elsewhere, do not save
' changes.

    Set swAssemblyDoc = swModel
```

    ' Set up event
    Set swAssemblyDocEvents = New Class1
    Set swAssemblyDocEvents.swAssemblyDoc = swApp.ActiveDoc
