# MakeLightWeight Method (IAssemblyDoc)

Sets the selected components to lightweight.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub MakeLightWeight()
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IAssemblyDoc

instance.MakeLightWeight()
```

### C#

```csharp
void MakeLightWeight()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void MakeLightWeight();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

## VBA Syntax

See

[AssemblyDoc::MakeLightWeight](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~AssemblyDoc~MakeLightWeight.html)

.

## Examples

[Make Assembly Components Lightweight (VBA)](Make_Assembly_Components_Lightweight_Example_VB.htm)

## Remarks

The purpose of this method is to support recording macros. You should use[IComponent2::GetSuppression](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IComponent2~GetSuppression.html)or[IComponent2::SetSuppression2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IComponent2~SetSuppression2.html)to get or set a component to lightweight.

This method sets the current selected components to lightweight, which is suitable for recording and running macros. IComponent2::GetSuppression and IComponent2::SetSuppression2 operate on the component itself.
