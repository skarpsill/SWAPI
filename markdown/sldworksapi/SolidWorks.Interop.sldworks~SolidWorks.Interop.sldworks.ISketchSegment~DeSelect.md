.

## VBA Syntax

See

[SketchSegment::DeSelect](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~SketchSegment~DeSelect.html)

.

## Remarks

This method does not work well when a PropertyManager page is open or a command is running. Use[IModelDoc2::DeSelectByID](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~DeSelectByID.html)instead of using this method. IModelDoc2::DeSelectByID handles selection correctly whether or not a command is running.

To select or deselect a sketch segment, the owning document of that ISketchSegment object needs to be open and visible.

ISketchSegment selections are accessible through the[ISelectionMgr](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISelectionMgr.html)of the owning document of the sketch segment object, even if the owning document is not active.

Selection or deselection does not work for a sketch segment in a document within a drawing. Selection or deselection of sketch segments owned by the drawing does work, but only if the drawing document is active.

If the owning sketch of a sketch segment was active, or inactive, when the sketch segment was obtained, then it must be active, or inactive, to deselect it. For example, if the owning sketch of a sketch segment was active when the sketch segment was obtained, then the owning sketch must be active to select or deselect the sketch segment. Likewise, if the owning sketch of a sketch segment was inactive when the sketch segment was obtained, then the owning sketch must be inactive to select or deselect the sketch segment.
