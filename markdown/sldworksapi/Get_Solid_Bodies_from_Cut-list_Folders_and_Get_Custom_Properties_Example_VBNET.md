# Get Solid Bodies from Cut-list Folders and Get Custom Properties Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to get the solid bodies from cut-list folders
and how to get the custom properties for the solid bodies.

```
'---------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open public_documents\samples\tutorial\api\weldment_box3.sldprt.
' 2. Click Tools > Options > Document Properties > Weldments >
'    Rename cut list folders with Description property value > OK.
' 3. Right-click Cut list(31) in the FeatureManager design tree
'    and click Update.
' 4. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Traverses the FeatureManager design tree.
' 2. Examine the Immediate window.
'
