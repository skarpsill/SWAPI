# IGetMakeIsoCurvesCount Method (ISurface)

Gets the number of curves that represent the ISO line of a given direction.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetMakeIsoCurvesCount( _
   ByRef UvRange As System.Double, _
   ByRef Dir As System.Double, _
   ByVal Angle As System.Double, _
   ByVal Tol As System.Double _
) As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISurface
Dim UvRange As System.Double
Dim Dir As System.Double
Dim Angle As System.Double
Dim Tol As System.Double
Dim value As System.Integer

value = instance.IGetMakeIsoCurvesCount(UvRange, Dir, Angle, Tol)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int IGetMakeIsoCurvesCount(
   ref System.double UvRange,
   ref System.double Dir,
   System.double Angle,
   System.double Tol
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.int IGetMakeIsoCurvesCount(
   System.double% UvRange,
   System.double% Dir,
   System.double Angle,
   System.double Tol
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `UvRange`: Array of 4 doubles indicating the range of surface to use (see

Remarks

)
- `Dir`: Array of 3 doubles indicating the direction of the projection on the surface (see

Remarks)
- `Angle`: Angle relative to Dir where to create the curves
- `Tol`: Tolerance of the curves to create

### Return Value

Number of curves to create

## VBA Syntax

See

[Surface::IGetMakeIsoCurvesCount](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Surface~IGetMakeIsoCurvesCount.html)

.

## Remarks

The uvRange argument is an array of 4 doubles indicating the minimum and maximum U and V values:

[u_min, u_max, v_min, v_max]

The dir argument is an array of 3 doubles representing the unit vector:

[x, y, z]
