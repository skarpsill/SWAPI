# Get Weldment Cut List Feature and Annotations Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to get a weldment cut list feature and weldment
cut list annotations.

```vb
  '----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
 ' 1. Open a Drawing document that has a weldment cut list table.
 ' 2. Open an Immediate window.
 '
 ' Postconditions: Inspect the Immediate window.
