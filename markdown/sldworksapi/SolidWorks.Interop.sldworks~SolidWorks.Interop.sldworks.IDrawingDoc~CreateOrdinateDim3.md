```vb
Function CreateOrdinateDim3( _
   ByVal P0 As System.Object, _
   ByVal P1 As System.Object, _
   ByVal P2 As System.Object, _
   ByVal P3 As System.Object, _
   ByVal P4 As System.Object, _
   ByVal Angle As System.Double, _
   ByVal ArrowSize As System.Double, _

Dim Angle As System.Double
Dim ArrowSize As System.Double
Dim Text As System.String
Dim TextHeight As System.Double
Dim WitnessGap As System.Double
Dim WitnessOvershoot As System.Double
Dim P5 As System.Object
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.CreateOrdinateDim3(P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, Angle, ArrowSize, Text, TextHeight, WitnessGap, WitnessOvershoot, P5)
```

### C#

```csharp
