# Process Body Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how create to a new part with an imported body from
the processed body of the original part.

```
'------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Verify that the specified part document template
'    exists.
' 2. Open a part containing only one solid body.
' 3. Open the Immediate window.
' 4. Run the macro.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Creates a new part with an imported body
'    from the processed body of the original part.
' 2. Examine the Immediate window.
'
' NOTE: Differences are best seen in wireframe and with parts
' that contain curved, circular, or both types of faces.
