```

value = instance.GetXform()
```

```

### C++/CLI

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

Array of 3 doubles that describe the location and scale of the drawing view (see

Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

See

[View::GetXform](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~View~GetXform.html)

.

## Remarks

The first two values returned are the X and Y locations of the view relative to the sheet origin, and the third value returned is the scale of the drawing view.

Because of a Microsoft compilation issue, the Dispatch name generated in the**swdisp.h**and**swdisp.cpp**files for the Dispatch version of this method is GetXform (with a lower-case letter f). To work around this:

- Use GetXform in your code instead of GetXForm.

  - or -
- Modify the swdisp.h and swdisp.cpp files so that the declaration for GetXForm in the[IView](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IView.html)object is changed to GetXform. Remember to change it when you upgrade the SOLIDWORKS software.
