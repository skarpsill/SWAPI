# Get ID of Active Configuration or Current Drawing Sheet Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to get the name and ID of the active configuration of
a part or assembly
or the current sheet of a drawing.

**NOTE**: A unique ID is assigned to each configuration and drawing. This ID does
not change when the name of the configuration or drawing sheet is changed.

```
'----------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open a part, assembly, or drawing document.
' 2. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Changes either the active configuration's name or
'    the current sheet's name to Test. However, the
'    document's ID is unchanged.
' 2. Examine the Immediate window.
