# FeatureChainPattern Method (IFeatureManager)

Obsolete.See[IFeatureManager::CreateFeature](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~CreateFeature.html)and the Remarks in[IChainPatternFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IChainPatternFeatureData.html).

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function FeatureChainPattern( _
   ByVal PitchMethod As System.Integer, _
   ByVal FlipDirection As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal FillPath As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal Number As System.Integer, _
   ByVal Spacing As System.Double, _
   ByVal GroupOneFlipPlane As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal GroupTwoChain As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal GroupTwoFlipPlane As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal AlignMethod As System.Integer, _
   ByVal Options As System.Integer _
) As Feature
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeatureManager
Dim PitchMethod As System.Integer
Dim FlipDirection As System.Boolean
Dim FillPath As System.Boolean
Dim Number As System.Integer
Dim Spacing As System.Double
Dim GroupOneFlipPlane As System.Boolean
Dim GroupTwoChain As System.Boolean
Dim GroupTwoFlipPlane As System.Boolean
Dim AlignMethod As System.Integer
Dim Options As System.Integer
Dim value As Feature

value = instance.FeatureChainPattern(PitchMethod, FlipDirection, FillPath, Number, Spacing, GroupOneFlipPlane, GroupTwoChain, GroupTwoFlipPlane, AlignMethod, Options)
```

### C#

```csharp
Feature FeatureChainPattern(
   System.int PitchMethod,
   System.bool FlipDirection,
   System.bool FillPath,
   System.int Number,
   System.double Spacing,
   System.bool GroupOneFlipPlane,
   System.bool GroupTwoChain,
   System.bool GroupTwoFlipPlane,
   System.int AlignMethod,
   System.int Options
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Feature^ FeatureChainPattern(
   System.int PitchMethod,
   System.bool FlipDirection,
   System.bool FillPath,
   System.int Number,
   System.double Spacing,
   System.bool GroupOneFlipPlane,
   System.bool GroupTwoChain,
   System.bool GroupTwoFlipPlane,
   System.int AlignMethod,
   System.int Options
)
```

- `GroupTwoFlipPlane`: True to flip the path alignment plane for

Chain Group 2

, false to not; only available for connected linkage chain patterns
- `AlignMethod`: Alignment method as defined in

## VBA Syntax

See

[FeatureManager::FeatureChainPattern](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~FeatureManager~FeatureChainPattern.html)

.

## Remarks

You must pre-select the entities for the chain pattern feature. Using the selected entities, this method inserts one of these chain pattern features:

- distance
- distance linkage
- connected linkage

| Entity to select | Corresponding Chain Pattern PropertyManager control | Selection mark | Number of selections |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2D or 3D sketch containing an open or closed loop, Sketch line , or Model edge | Path | 2 | 1 for all types of chain patterns |
| Assembly component | Chain Group 1 Component to Pattern | 1 | 1 for all types of chain patterns |
| Cylindrical face , Circular or linear edge, Sketch point , Vertex , or Reference axis | Chain Group 1 Path Link 1 | 256 | 1 for all types of chain patterns |
| Cylindrical face, Circular or linear edge, Sketch point, Vertex, or Reference axis | Chain Group 1 Path Link 2 | 512 | 1 for distance linkage or connected linkage None for distance |
| Component plane or planar face | Chain Group 1 Path Alignment Plane | 16384 | 1 for all types of chain patterns |
| Assembly component | Chain Group 2 Component to Pattern | 2048 | 1 for connected linkage None for distance or linkage distance |
| Cylindrical face, Circular or linear edge, Sketch point, Vertex, or Reference axis | Chain Group 2 Path Link 1 | 4096 | 1 for connected linkage None for distance or linkage distance |
| Cylindrical face, Circular or linear edge, Sketch point, Vertex, or Reference axis | Chain Group 2 Path Link 2 | 8192 | 1 for connected linkage None for distance or linkage distance |
| Component plane or planar face | Group 2 Path Alignment Plane | 32768 | 1 for connected linkage None for distance or linkage distance |
| Assembly plane | Face normal alignment | 1024 | 1 if the chain path is a sketch line None for all other types of paths |

To[set equal spacing](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IChainPatternFeatureData~SetEqualSpacing.html)between chain pattern instances, edit the chain pattern feature after creating it.
