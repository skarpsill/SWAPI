# MultipleStart Property (IThreadFeatureData)

Gets or sets whether the thread has multiple starts in this thread feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property MultipleStart As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IThreadFeatureData
Dim value As System.Boolean

instance.MultipleStart = value

value = instance.MultipleStart
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool MultipleStart {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.bool MultipleStart {
   System.bool get();
   void set (    System.bool value);
}
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Property Value

True if the thread has multiple starts, false if not (default)

## VBA Syntax

See

[ThreadFeatureData::MultipleStart](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~ThreadFeatureData~MultipleStart.html)

.

## Examples

See the

[IThreadFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IThreadFeatureData.html)

examples.

## Remarks

If this property is set to true, use[IThreadFeatureData::NumberOfStarts](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IThreadFeatureData~NumberOfStarts.html)to set the number of times the thread is created in an evenly-spaced circular pattern around the hole or shaft.

[IThreadFeatureData::Pitch](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IThreadFeatureData~Pitch.html)must permit multiple starts without causing crossing or self-intersecting threads. For example, the pitch of one thread must be wide enough to allow the nesting of other threads of different pitch.
