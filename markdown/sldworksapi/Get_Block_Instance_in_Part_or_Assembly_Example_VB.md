# Get Block Instance in Part or Assembly Example (VBA)

This example shows how to get a block instance and its block definition.

'-------------------------------------------------

'

' Precondition:

'kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}(1)
Part or assembly document is open

'kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}that
has at least one block instance.

'kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}(2)
Block instance is selected.

'

' Postconditions: None
