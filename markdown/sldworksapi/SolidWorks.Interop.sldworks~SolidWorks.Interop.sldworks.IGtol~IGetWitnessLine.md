# IGetWitnessLine Method (IGtol)

Gets the extension line that connects the leader of this geometric tolerance with the entity that is being dimensioned.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetWitnessLine() As System.Double
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IGtol
Dim value As System.Double

value = instance.IGetWitnessLine()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.double IGetWitnessLine()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.double IGetWitnessLine();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to array of six doubles (see

  Remarks

  )

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

## Remarks

As you drag a geometric tolerance leader off an entity, SOLIDWORKS dynamically builds a witness or extension line that connects the leader to the entity.

The return value is the following array of six doubles:

[startPt[3], endPt[3]]

where:

- startPt[3] = x,y,z start point coordinates of the witness line
- endPt[3] = x,y,z end point coordinates of the witness line
