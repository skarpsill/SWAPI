# ICross Method (IMathVector)

Gets the cross product between two math vectors.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function ICross( _
   ByVal VectorObjIn As MathVector _
) As MathVector
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IMathVector
Dim VectorObjIn As MathVector
Dim value As MathVector

value = instance.ICross(VectorObjIn)
```

### C#

```csharp
MathVector ICross(
   MathVector VectorObjIn
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
MathVector^ ICross(
   MathVector^ VectorObjIn
)
```

NOTE:
