# Get Explode Step Component Transform Example (VBA)

This example shows how to get the transformation matrix of a component in a
radial explode step and apply it to another component to overlap the components.

'----------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open an assembly with an explode view with at least one radial explode
' step with at least two components.
' 2. Activate the explode view.
' 3. Replace`component_name`in the code below with the name of a second
' component to overlap the first.
' 4. Open an Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions: For each explode step:
' 1. Gets the transformation matrix of a component in the radial explode step.
' 2. Selects another component to overlap.
' 3. Applies the transformation matrix to overlap the components.
' 4. Prints to the Immediate window the transformation matrix for the component.
