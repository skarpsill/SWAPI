## Remarks

[ISurfaceRadiateFeatureData::AccessSelections](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISurfaceRadiateFeatureData~AccessSelections.html)and[ISurfaceRadiateFeatureData::IAccessSelections](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISurfaceRadiateFeatureData~IAccessSelections.html)put the model in a rollback state to allow access to the selections that define the feature.

Use this method to restore the rollback state if you did not modify the feature, or use[IFeature::ModifyDefinition](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html)or[IFeature::IModifyDefinition2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~IModifyDefinition2.html)if you did modify the feature.
