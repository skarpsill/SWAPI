# PostSplitBody Method (IFeatureManager)

Obsolete. Superseded by

[IFeatureManager::PostSplitBody2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~PostSplitBody2.html)

.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function PostSplitBody( _
   ByVal BodiesToMark As System.Object, _
   ByVal ConsumeCut As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal Origins As System.Object, _
   ByVal SavePaths As System.Object _
) As Feature
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeatureManager
Dim BodiesToMark As System.Object
Dim ConsumeCut As System.Boolean
Dim Origins As System.Object
Dim SavePaths As System.Object
Dim value As Feature

value = instance.PostSplitBody(BodiesToMark, ConsumeCut, Origins, SavePaths)
```

### C#

```csharp
Feature PostSplitBody(
   System.object BodiesToMark,
   System.bool ConsumeCut,
   System.object Origins,
   System.object SavePaths
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Feature^ PostSplitBody(
   System.Object^ BodiesToMark,
   System.bool ConsumeCut,
   System.Object^ Origins,
   System.Object^ SavePaths
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `BodiesToMark`: Bodies to mark for the split operation
- `ConsumeCut`: True to remove the bodies from the part, false to not
- `Origins`: Array of origins of the bodies to save
- `SavePaths`: Array of paths and filenames of part documents to which to save BodiesToMark

### Return Value

Pointer to the split-body

[feature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature.html)

## VBA Syntax

See

[FeatureManager::PostSplitBody](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~FeatureManager~PostSplitBody.html)

.

## Remarks

To create a split-body feature:

1. Select the entities to use to split the part into multiple bodies.
2. Call[IFeatureManager::PreSplitBody](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~PreSplitBody.html)to get all of the bodies created by splitting the part.
3. Call this method to create the split-body feature.

The size of the BodiesToMark, Origins, and SavePaths arrays must be equal and greater than 0. If you pass an empty path and filename for a body, then that body is only marked and not saved. It remains with the original part.

To find out if the bodies in a split-body feature were consumed, use[ISplitBodyFeatureData::Consume](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISplitBodyFeatureData~Consume.html).

[IFeature::GetTypeName2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetTypeName2.html)and[IFeature::GetTypeName](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetTypeName.html)return:

- Split

  for a feature that was created by splitting a part into multiple parts by using either this method or the

  Split

  feature in the user interface. You can access a split-body feature's data using the

  [ISplitBodyFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISplitBodyFeatureData.html)

  interface.
- SplitBody

  for a body created by splitting a part and saving the body to a part. You cannot access the data of a split body saved to a part.
