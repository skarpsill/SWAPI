   ByVal Component As Component2 _
) As System.Boolean
```

Dim instance As IExtrudeFeatureData2
Dim TopDoc As ModelDoc2
Dim Component As Component2
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.IAccessSelections(TopDoc, Component)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool IAccessSelections(
   ModelDoc2 TopDoc,
   Component2 Component
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool IAccessSelections(
   ModelDoc2^ TopDoc,
   Component2^ Component
)
```

### Parameters

- `TopDoc`: Top-level document (see**Remarks**)
- `Component`: Component in which the feature is to be modified (see**Remarks**)

This method puts the model into a rollback state to allow access to the selections that define this feature. You must use either of the following methods to restore the rollback state:

- [IFeature::IModifyDefintion2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~IModifyDefinition2.html)

  if you modified the feature
- [IExtrudeFeatureData2::ReleaseSelectionAccess](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IExtrudeFeatureData2~ReleaseSelectionAccess.html)

  if you did not
