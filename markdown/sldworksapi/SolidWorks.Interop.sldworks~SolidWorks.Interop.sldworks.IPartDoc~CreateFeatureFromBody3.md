# CreateFeatureFromBody3 Method (IPartDoc)

Creates a new imported feature from the specified temporary body.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function CreateFeatureFromBody3( _
   ByVal Body As System.Object, _
   ByVal MakeRefSurface As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal Options As System.Integer _
) As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IPartDoc
Dim Body As System.Object
Dim MakeRefSurface As System.Boolean
Dim Options As System.Integer
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.CreateFeatureFromBody3(Body, MakeRefSurface, Options)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object CreateFeatureFromBody3(
   System.object Body,
   System.bool MakeRefSurface,
   System.int Options
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ CreateFeatureFromBody3(
   System.Object^ Body,
   System.bool MakeRefSurface,
   System.int Options
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Body`: Temporary

[body](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IBody2.html)
- `MakeRefSurface`: If the body cannot be knitted to a solid or if a solid body already exists in this model, then True creates a reference surface feature
- `Options`: Options as defined in

[swCreateFeatureBodyOpts_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swCreateFeatureBodyOpts_e.html)

### Return Value

Newly created imported

[feature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature.html)

or Nothing or NULL if the operation fails

## Remarks

This method is intended to be the final call in a knitting operation. The body that results from your knitting efforts can be converted into an imported body feature in the SOLIDWORKS model. This method is not limited to body objects obtained from knitting operations.

This method allows the application to decide how much additional work needs to be done to the model before creating the feature. The options listed in the swCreateFeatureBodyOpts_e enumeration can be OR'd together to provide additional checking or simplification of the model. If you specify swCreateFeatureBodySimplify for Options, then swCreateFeatureBodyCheck is implied.

If the application passes 0 for the options argument, then the options are disabled and the model is passed without any checking. If so, it is up to the application to ensure that the model is a valid model.

If this method fails, the error might be caused by creating a sheet (surface) body from a multiple shells body. If so, replace this method with[IPartDoc::CreateSurfaceFeatureFromBody](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IPartDoc~CreateSurfaceFeatureFromBody.html)or[IPartDoc::ICreateSurfaceFeatureFromBody](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IPartDoc~ICreateSurfaceFeatureFromBody.html).
