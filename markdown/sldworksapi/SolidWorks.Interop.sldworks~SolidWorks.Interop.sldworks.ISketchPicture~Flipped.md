Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

See

[SketchPicture::Flipped](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/Sldworks~SketchPicture~Flipped.html)

.

## Examples

See the

[ISketchPicture](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISketchPicture.html)

examples.

## Remarks

When a picture has not been flipped, as when you initially insert it, the bottom of the picture is defined by starting at the origin and proceeding in the direction of the[angle](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchPicture~Angle.html). If a picture has been flipped, then the bottom of the picture is defined by starting at the origin and proceeding in a direction opposite the angle. In other words, the picture is mirrored or reflected, but not duplicated.

If a picture has been[flipped](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchPicture~Flip.html)both side to side and top to bottom, then this property returns false.
