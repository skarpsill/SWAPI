# Get Number of Instances Skipped in Driving Feature Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to get the number of instances skipped in the driving feature
of a derived pattern feature.

```
'--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open public_documents\samples\tutorial\api\PatternDrivenComponentPattern.sldasm.
' 2. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Adds instances to skip in the local linear pattern feature.
' 2. Inserts a derived pattern feature.
' 3. Gets the number of instances skipped in the driving feature for the
'    derived pattern feature.
' 4. Gets whether visual properties are propagated in the derived pattern
'    feature.
' 5. Examine the FeatureManager design tree, graphics area, and
'    Immediate window.
'
' NOTE: Because the assembly is used elsewhere, do not save changes.
