A defeature configuration is a type of derived configuration. After using the Defeature tool to remove details from assemblies, multibody parts, and single-body parts, you can save the less-detailed model as a configuration and maintain references to the original part or assembly.

For more information see the**SOLIDWORKS user-interface help > Assemblies > Other Assembly Techniques > Defeature**topic.
