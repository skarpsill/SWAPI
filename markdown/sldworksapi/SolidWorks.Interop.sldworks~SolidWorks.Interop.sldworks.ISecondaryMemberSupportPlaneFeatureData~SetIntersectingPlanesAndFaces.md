# SetIntersectingPlanesAndFaces Method (ISecondaryMemberSupportPlaneFeatureData)

Sets the planar entities that intersect the primary structure system member pairs used to create this secondary structure system member.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function SetIntersectingPlanesAndFaces( _
   ByVal RefArray As System.Object _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISecondaryMemberSupportPlaneFeatureData
Dim RefArray As System.Object
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.SetIntersectingPlanesAndFaces(RefArray)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool SetIntersectingPlanesAndFaces(
   System.object RefArray
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool SetIntersectingPlanesAndFaces(
   System.Object^ RefArray
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

- `RefArray`: Array of

[IRefPlane](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IRefPlane.html)

s,

[ISurface](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISurface.html)

s, and/or

[IFace2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFace2.html)

s

### Return Value

True if intersecting planes and faces successfully set, false if not

## VBA Syntax

See

[SecondaryMemberSupportPlaneFeatureData::SetIntersectingPlanesAndFaces](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~SecondaryMemberSupportPlaneFeatureData~SetIntersectingPlanesAndFaces.html)
