```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IMoveFaceFeatureData
Dim value As System.Double

instance.Distance = value

value = instance.Distance
```

### C#

```csharp
System.double Distance {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp

### Property Value

Offset distance of this offset or translated Move Face feature (see

## VBA Syntax

See

[MoveFaceFeatureData::Distance](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~MoveFaceFeatureData~Distance.html)

.

## Examples

[Translate Move Face Feature (C#)](Translate_Move_Face_Feature_Example_CSharp.htm)

[Translate Move Face Feature (VB.NET)](Translate_Move_Face_Feature_Example_VBNET.htm)

[Translate Move Face Feature (VBA)](Translate_Move_Face_Feature_Example_VB.htm)

## Remarks

To find out whether the Move Face feature was offset or translated, use[IMoveFaceFeatureData::MoveType](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IMoveFaceFeatureData~MoveType.html).

If setting the offset distance of a translated Move Face feature that has an[end condition](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IMoveFaceFeatureData~EndCondition.html)of**Offset From Surface**, then use[IMoveFaceFeatureData::OffsetDistance](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IMoveFaceFeatureData~OffsetDistance.html). For all other end conditions, use IMoveFaceFeatureData::Distance to set the offset distance.
