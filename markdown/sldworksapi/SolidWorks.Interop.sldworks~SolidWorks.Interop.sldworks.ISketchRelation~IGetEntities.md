# IGetEntities Method (ISketchRelation)

Gets the entities associated with this sketch relation.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetEntities( _
   ByVal NumEntities As System.Integer _
) As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISketchRelation
Dim NumEntities As System.Integer
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.IGetEntities(NumEntities)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object IGetEntities(
   System.int NumEntities
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ IGetEntities(
   System.int NumEntities
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `NumEntities`: Number of entities

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of entities for this sketch relation

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

## Remarks

When you create a sketch relation, an internal entity may also be created to define that sketch relation. For example, if you add a sketch relation by specifying or selecting a point and an edge, a sketch segment may be created. If this happens, then[ISketchRelation::GetEntities](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchRelation~GetEntities.html)and ISketchRelation::IGetEntities return the point and sketch segment. To get the actual entities used to define the sketch relation, call[ISketchRelation::GetDefinitionEntities](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchRelation~GetDefinitionEntities.html)or[ISketchRelation::IGetDefinitionEntities](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchRelation~IGetDefinitionEntities.html).

Because some of the objects may be NULL, you should check for this before accessing them. You should deallocate any dynamically allocated memory.

Before calling this method, call[ISketchRelation::GetEntitiesCount](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchRelation~GetEntitiesCount.html)to get the value for NumEntities.
