# Get Sketch Points Example (VBA)

This example shows how to loop through a
selected sketch that has one or more sketch points and get the x and y
coordinates of every sketch point.

```
'-------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open a model containing a sketch with one or more
'    sketch points.
' 2. Select the sketch.
' 3. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Gets the value for each sketch point in the sketch.
' 2. Gets the x and y coordinates of each sketch
'    point in the sketch.
' 3. Examine the Immediate window.

    Set swSketch = swFeat.GetSpecificFeature2
    Debug.Print "FeatName = " + swFeat.Name
    Debug.Print " "
```

```
    sketchPointArray = swSketch.GetSketchPoints2
    For i = 0 To UBound(sketchPointArray)
        ' Get value returned by ISketchPoint::GetCoords

        Debug.Print "Value returned by ISketchPoint::GetCoords: " & swSketchPoint.GetCoords

        yValue = sketchPointArray(i).Y
