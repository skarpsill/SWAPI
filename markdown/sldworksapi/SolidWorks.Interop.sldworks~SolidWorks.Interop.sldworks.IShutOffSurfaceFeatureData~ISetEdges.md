# ISetEdges Method (IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData)

Sets the edges to use to form closed loops for patches.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub ISetEdges( _
   ByVal Count As System.Integer, _
   ByRef EdgeArr As Edge _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData
Dim Count As System.Integer
Dim EdgeArr As Edge

instance.ISetEdges(Count, EdgeArr)
```

### C#

```csharp
void ISetEdges(
   System.int Count,
   ref Edge EdgeArr
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void ISetEdges(
   System.int Count,
   Edge^% EdgeArr
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Count`: Number of edges
- `EdgeArr`: - in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of

  [edges](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IEdge.html)

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported
