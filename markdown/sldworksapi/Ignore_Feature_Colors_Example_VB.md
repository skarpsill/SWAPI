# Ignore Feature Colors Example (VBA)

This example shows how to change a user preference option so that feature
colors are ignored in parts. This option setting,swIgnoreFeatureColors,can be true or false and can be different for each document. It is not
a system-level setting; it is a document-level setting. Therefore, you
must set this value for each document.

By default, when a document is created,swIgnoreFeatureColorsis false.

```
'----------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions: Open a part document.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Gets current setting for swIgnoreFeatureColors and
'    pops up a message box. Click OK to close the message
'    box.
' 2. Pops up a message box prior to setting swIgnoreFeatureColors
'    to true. Click OK to close the message box.
' 3. Sets swIgnoreFeatureColors to true and pops up a message
'    box indicating setting swIgnoreFeatureColors to true
'    is successful. Click OK to close the message box.
