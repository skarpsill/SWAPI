## Examples

[Create Rack and Pinion Mate (C#)](Rack_and_Pinion_Mate_Example_CSharp.htm)

## Remarks

A rack and pinion mate consists of two components where:

- One component (the rack) causes circular rotation in another component (the pinion) and vice versa.
- Neither component is required to have gear teeth.

[IMateFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IMateFeatureData.html)is the parent of this mate interface.

To create a rack and pinion mate:

1. Follow general instructions in the

  [IAssemblyDoc::CreateMate](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IAssemblyDoc~CreateMate.html)

  Remarks.
2. Use

  [IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~SelectByID2.html)

  to pre-select the entities using Mark = 64 for the rack edge and Mark = 128 for the pinion face.
3. Specify other properties of the RackPinionMateFeatureData object as required.

To edit a rack and pinion mate:

1. Access its feature and call

  [IFeature::GetDefinition](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetDefinition.html)

  to get the MateFeatureData object.
2. Cast the MateFeatureData object to a RackPinionMateFeatureData object.
3. Modify the RackPinionMateFeatureData object.
4. Call

  [IFeature::ModifyDefinition](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html)

  .

To delete this rack and pinion mate, use[IModelDocExtension::DeleteSelection2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~DeleteSelection2.html).
