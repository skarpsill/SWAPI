## Examples

## Remarks

A screw mate consists of two components, where:

- Components are concentric.
- Translation of one component along the axis causes rotation of the other component according to a pitch relationship.
- Rotation of one component causes translation of the other component.

[IMateFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IMateFeatureData.html)is the parent of this mate interface.

To create a screw mate:

1. Follow general instructions in the

  [IAssemblyDoc::CreateMate](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IAssemblyDoc~CreateMate.html)

  Remarks.
2. Specify

  [IScrewMateFeatureData::EntitiesToMate](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IScrewMateFeatureData~EntitiesToMate.html)

  or use

  [IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~SelectByID2.html)

  to pre-select the entities using Mark = 1.
3. Specify other properties of the ScrewMateFeatureData object. as required.

To edit a screw mate:

1. Access its feature and call

  [IFeature::GetDefinition](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetDefinition.html)

  to get the MateFeatureData object.
2. Cast the MateFeatureData object to a ScrewMateFeatureData object.
3. Modify the ScrewMateFeatureData object.
4. Call

  [IFeature::ModifyDefinition](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html)

  .

To delete this screw mate, use[IModelDocExtension::DeleteSelection2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~DeleteSelection2.html).
