# CreateChamfer Method (ISketchManager)

Creates a chamfer between two selected sketch entities.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function CreateChamfer( _
   ByVal Type As System.Integer, _
   ByVal Distance As System.Double, _
   ByVal AngleORdist As System.Double _
) As SketchSegment
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISketchManager
Dim Type As System.Integer
Dim Distance As System.Double
Dim AngleORdist As System.Double
Dim value As SketchSegment

value = instance.CreateChamfer(Type, Distance, AngleORdist)
```

### C#

```csharp
SketchSegment CreateChamfer(
   System.int Type,
   System.double Distance,
   System.double AngleORdist
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
SketchSegment^ CreateChamfer(
   System.int Type,
   System.double Distance,
   System.double AngleORdist
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Type`: Type of chamfer as defined in

[swSketchChamferType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.interop.swconst.swSketchChamferType_e.html)
- `Distance`: Distance of the chamfer
- `AngleORdist`: - If Type = swSketchChamfer_DistanceDistance, then the second chamfer distance
- If Type = swSketchChamfer_DistanceAngle, then the second chamfer angle
- If Type = swSketchChamfer_DistanceEqual, then this argument is ignored because Distance

  is used for both edges

### Return Value

[Sketch segment](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchSegment.html)

for the chamfer
