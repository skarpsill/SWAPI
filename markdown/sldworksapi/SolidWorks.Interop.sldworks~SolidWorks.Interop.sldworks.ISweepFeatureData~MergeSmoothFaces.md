## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property MergeSmoothFaces As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISweepFeatureData
Dim value As System.Boolean

instance.MergeSmoothFaces = value

value = instance.MergeSmoothFaces
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool MergeSmoothFaces {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.bool MergeSmoothFaces {
   System.bool get();
   void set (    System.bool value);
}
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Property Value

True to merge the smooth faces, false to not (see

Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

See

[SweepFeatureData::MergeSmoothFaces](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~SweepFeatureData~MergeSmoothFaces.html)

.

## Examples

See the

[ISweepFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISweepFeatureData.html)

examples.

## Remarks

This property corresponds to theMerge smooth facescheck box on theGuide Curvesgroup box on theSweepPropertyManager.

Setting this property to false improves the performance of sweeps with guide curves and segments the sweep at all points where the guide curve or path is not curvature continuous.
