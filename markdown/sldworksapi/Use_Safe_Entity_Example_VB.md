# Use Safe Entity Example (VBA)

This example shows how to use the safe entity functionality.

**NOTE:**In general, an entity is something that can be selected through the user
interface. Examples of safe entities include vertices, edges, faces, and
features. An entity is useful because you can add an attribute to it to store arbitrary
user information. Entities are also useful because they support direct selection
through IEntity::Select4. Under normal conditions, an entity is transient and is not valid when the
model is rebuilt. Thus, if a rebuild occurs, then the entity must be reacquired.
This can be time consuming and prone to errors. Furthermore, it increases the
programming complexity. Safe entities are valid across rebuilds of the model. However, this type ofkadov_tag{{</spaces>}}entity
is not valid across sessions of SOLIDWORKS.kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}

```
'------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open a part, fully resolved assembly, or drawing.
' 2. Select one of these entities in the graphics area:
'    * vertex
'    * edge
'    * face
'    * feature
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Rebuilds the model.
' 2. Reselects the entity.
'
' NOTE: This code does not work for a feature selected
' in the FeatureManager design tree in a drawing.
