## Remarks

You must preselect the subassembly to dissolve when you run this method.

This method automatically deletes any features that need to be deleted as a result of the dissolve operation, without input from the user.

This method closes any component files when called in an assembly. If the components were modified, then those modifications are not automatically saved. You must save any modifications before the files are closed.
