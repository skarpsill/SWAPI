Because this method is valid only for 32-bit applications, it is now obsolete.

To insert a Task Pane view window, create your Task Pane view window and pass its handle to SOLIDWORKS using[ITaskpaneView::DisplayWindowFromHandlex64](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ITaskpaneView~DisplayWindowFromHandlex64.html).
