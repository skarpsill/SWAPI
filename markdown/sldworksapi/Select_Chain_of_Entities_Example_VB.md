Option Explicit
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks
 Dim Part As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
 Dim SelMgr As SldWorks.SelectionMgr
 Dim sketchSegment As SldWorks.sketchSegment
 Dim SelData As SldWorks.SelectData
 Dim boolstatus As Boolean
Sub main()
    Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
     Set Part = swApp.ActiveDoc
     Set SelMgr = Part.SelectionManager
     Set SelData = SelMgr.CreateSelectData
     boolstatus = Part.Extension.SelectByID2("Line3@Sketch2", "EXTSKETCHSEGMENT", -0.01022262320328, 0.01646364019604, 0, False, 0, Nothing, 0)
     Set sketchSegment = SelMgr.GetSelectedObject6(1, -1)
     boolstatus = sketchSegment.SelectChain(True, SelData)
End Sub
