# Select All in Part, Assembly, or Drawing (VB.NET)

This example shows how to select everything in the graphics area of a part or
assembly document or in the sheet of a drawing document, as if you box-selected everything in the graphics area or
the sheet.

```vb
 '--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
 ' 1. Part, assembly, and drawing documents opened by the macro
 '    exist.
 ' 2. Open the Immediate window.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1. Examine:
 '    * Sheet to verify that all of the entities in the drawing
 '      are selected.
 '    * Immediate window to see how many entities are selected.
 ' 2. Click Window > bolt-assembly.sldasm to switch to the assembly
 '    document.
 ' 3. Examine:
 '    * Graphics area to verify that the all of the components
 '      in the assembly are selected.
 '    * Immediate window to see how many components are selected.
 ' 4. Click Window > bolt.sldprt to switch to the part document.
 ' 5. Examine:
 '    * Graphics area to verify that the all of the edges
 '      in the part are selected.
 '    * Immediate window to see how many edges are selected.
 '
 ' NOTE: Because these documents are used elsewhere, do not save changes.
