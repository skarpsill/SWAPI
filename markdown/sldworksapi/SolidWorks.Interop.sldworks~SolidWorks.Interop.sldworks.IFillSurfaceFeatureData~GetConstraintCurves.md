# GetConstraintCurves Method (IFillSurfaceFeatureData)

Gets the constraint curves for this fill-surface feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetConstraintCurves( _
   ByRef TypeArr As System.Object _
) As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFillSurfaceFeatureData
Dim TypeArr As System.Object
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.GetConstraintCurves(TypeArr)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object GetConstraintCurves(
   out System.object TypeArr
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ GetConstraintCurves(
   [Out] System.Object^ TypeArr
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `TypeArr`: Array of types of entities used to constrain the surface as defined by[swSelectType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swSelectType_e.html); valid entities are:

- edges (swSelEDGES)
- sketches (swSelSKETCHES)

### Return Value

Array of entities used as constraint curves

## VBA Syntax
