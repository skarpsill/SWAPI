Dim instance As ISketchRelation
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.GetDefinitionEntities2()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object GetDefinitionEntities2()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ GetDefinitionEntities2();
```

NOTE:

### Return Value

Array of the actual entities for this sketch relation

## VBA Syntax

## Remarks

When you create a sketch relation, an internal entity may be created to define that sketch relation. For example, if you add a sketch relation by specifying or selecting a point and an edge, a sketch segment may be created. If this happens, then[ISketchRelation::GetEntities](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchRelation~GetEntities.html)and[ISketchRelation::IGetEntities](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchRelation~IGetEntities.html)return the point and sketch segment.

To get the actual entities used to define the sketch relation, call ISketchRelation::GetDefinitionEntities2 or[ISketchRelation::IGetDefinitionEntities2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchRelation~IGetDefinitionEntities2.html). For example, if the relation is of type[swConstraintType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swConstraintType_e.html).swConstraintType_OFFSETEDGE, and the relation is created by selecting a face, then this method returns that face.

Because some of the objects may be null, you should check for null before accessing them. You should deallocate any dynamically allocated memory.
