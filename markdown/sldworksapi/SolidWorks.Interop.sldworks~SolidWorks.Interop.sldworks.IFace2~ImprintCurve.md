# ImprintCurve Method (IFace2)

Imprints a curve on the selected face.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub ImprintCurve( _
   ByVal Curve As System.Object, _
   ByRef NewEdges As System.Object, _
   ByRef NewFaces As System.Object _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFace2
Dim Curve As System.Object
Dim NewEdges As System.Object
Dim NewFaces As System.Object

instance.ImprintCurve(Curve, NewEdges, NewFaces)
```

### C#

```csharp
void ImprintCurve(
   System.object Curve,
   out System.object NewEdges,
   out System.object NewFaces
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void ImprintCurve(
   System.Object^ Curve,
   [Out] System.Object^ NewEdges,
   [Out] System.Object^ NewFaces
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Curve`: [Curve](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ICurve.html)

to imprint on the face
- `NewEdges`: Array of new[edges](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IEdge.html)created by the imprinted curve
- `NewFaces`: Array of new

[faces](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFace2.html)

created by the imprinted curve

## VBA Syntax

See

[Face2::ImprintCurve](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Face2~ImprintCurve.html)

.

## Remarks

The specified curve must lie on the face.

To imprint a curve on a new face of a temporary body, create a copy of the original curve and imprint the copy of the curve on the new face.
