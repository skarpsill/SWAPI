Gets the face associated with this sketch hatch.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

Dim instance As ISketchHatch
Dim value As Face2

value = instance.IGetFace2()
```

### C#

```csharp
Face2 IGetFace2()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Face2^ IGetFace2();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

[Face](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFace2.html)

associated with the sketch hatch or null if the operation fails

## VBA Syntax

See

[SketchHatch::IGetFace2](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~SketchHatch~IGetFace2.html)

.

## Remarks

You should not select the returned face. Only use the returned face for getting the geometry of the sketch hatch: loops, edges, equations for the edges, and so on. Do not hold onto the pointer the face after it is used as the face is transient.
