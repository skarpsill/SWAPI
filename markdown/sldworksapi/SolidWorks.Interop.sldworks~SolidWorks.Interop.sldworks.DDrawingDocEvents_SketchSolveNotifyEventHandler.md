# DDrawingDocEvents_SketchSolveNotifyEventHandler Delegate (SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks)

Fired whenever the sketch is solved; for example, when dragging a sketch entity, adding or editing relations, changing dimensions, and so on. This event returns the name of the sketch feature being updated.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Public Delegate Function DDrawingDocEvents_SketchSolveNotifyEventHandler( _
   ByVal featName As System.String _
) As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As New DDrawingDocEvents_SketchSolveNotifyEventHandler(AddressOf HandlerMethod)
```

### C#

```csharp
public delegate System.int DDrawingDocEvents_SketchSolveNotifyEventHandler(
   System.string featName
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
public delegate System.int DDrawingDocEvents_SketchSolveNotifyEventHandler(
   System.String^ featName
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `featName`: Name of sketch feature being updated

## VBA Syntax

See

[SketchSolveNotify Event (DrawingDoc)](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/SldWorks~DrawingDoc~SketchSolveNotify_EV.html)

.

## Remarks

Pressing the Ctrl+Q keys rebuilds drawing sketches ( IView::GetSketch or IView::IGetSketch ), which causes this event to fire.

If developing a C++ application, use swDrawingSketchSolveNotify to register for this notification.
