# InsertMirrorFeature Method (IFeatureManager)

Obsolete. Superseded by

[IFeatureManager::InsertMirrorFeature2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~InsertMirrorFeature2.html)

.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function InsertMirrorFeature( _
   ByVal BMirrorBody As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal BGeometryPattern As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal BMerge As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal BKnit As System.Boolean _
) As Feature
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeatureManager
Dim BMirrorBody As System.Boolean
Dim BGeometryPattern As System.Boolean
Dim BMerge As System.Boolean
Dim BKnit As System.Boolean
Dim value As Feature

value = instance.InsertMirrorFeature(BMirrorBody, BGeometryPattern, BMerge, BKnit)
```

### C#

```csharp
Feature InsertMirrorFeature(
   System.bool BMirrorBody,
   System.bool BGeometryPattern,
   System.bool BMerge,
   System.bool BKnit
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Feature^ InsertMirrorFeature(
   System.bool BMirrorBody,
   System.bool BGeometryPattern,
   System.bool BMerge,
   System.bool BKnit
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `BMirrorBody`: True to mirror solid bodies; false to mirror a feature or face
- `BGeometryPattern`: True to mirror only the feature geometry, false to solve the entire feature; applies

to mirroring features only
- `BMerge`: True to merge any mirrored solid bodies, false to not; applies to mirroring solid

bodies only
- `BKnit`: True to knit surfaces, false to not; applies to mirroring surfaces only

### Return Value

Pointer to the

[IFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature.html)

object

## VBA Syntax

See

[FeatureManager::InsertMirrorFeature](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~FeatureManager~InsertMirrorFeature.html)

.

## Remarks

This method attempts to create the mirror feature without displaying a dialog box to get information from the user. It relies on preselected and marked entities, as well as arguments.

(Table)=========================================================

| Any... | Must be preselected and marked with a value of... |
| --- | --- |
| Features to be mirrored | 1 |
| Faces to be mirrored | 128 |
| Bodies to be mirrored | 256 |
| Plane or planar face | 2 |

For information on selecting and marking entities, see[IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~SelectByID2.html).
