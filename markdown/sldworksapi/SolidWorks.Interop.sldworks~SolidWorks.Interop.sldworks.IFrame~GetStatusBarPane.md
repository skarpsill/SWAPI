.

### Return Value

Pointer to a[status bar pane object](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IStatusBarPane.html)

## VBA Syntax

See

[Frame::GetStatusBarPane](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Frame~GetStatusBarPane.html)

.

## Remarks

There are only 5 panes available starting from the right of the screen to the existing SOLIDWORKS panes.

This method returns a null pointer to a pane when you have used all possible panes.

These objects appear on the status bar until they go out of scope. To use them in a project, they should be declared globally in the Visual Basic project and managed during the life cycle of the client application.
