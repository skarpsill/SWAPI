# IRefPlaneFeatureData Interface

Allows access to reference plane feature data.

**NOTE:**Click the**Members**link, located near the top of the topic, to see this interface's methods and properties.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Public Interface IRefPlaneFeatureData
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IRefPlaneFeatureData
```

### C#

```csharp
public interface IRefPlaneFeatureData
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
public interface class IRefPlaneFeatureData
```

## VBA Syntax

See

[RefPlaneFeatureData](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~RefPlaneFeatureData.html)

.

## Examples

[Insert Reference Plane (VBA)](Insert_Reference_Plane_Example_VB.htm)

[Insert Reference Plane (C#)](Insert_Reference_Plane_Example_CSharp.htm)

## Remarks

Before calling any of the methods and properties on this interface, you should determine the reference plane's type because some IRefPlaneFeatureData methods and properties only work with constraint-based reference planes and some only work with non-constrained reference planes. Use[IRefPlaneFeatureData::Type2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IRefPlaneFeatureData~Type2.html)to determine the type of reference plane.

If IRefPlaneFeatureData::Type2 returns swRefPlaneConstraintBase, then the reference plane is constraint based. To determine if a constraint-based reference plane has angle or offset distances references, call[IRefPlaneFeatureData::Type](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IRefPlaneFeatureData~Type.html):

- swRefPlaneAngle is returned for angle references.
- swRefPlaneDistance is returned for offset distance references.

Otherwise, the reference plane is not constraint based. Call[IRefPlaneFeatureData::Type](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IRefPlaneFeatureData~Type.html)to determine its type.

**NOTE:**Reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2010 or later are constraint based; reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2009 or earlier are not.

The following table shows which IRefPlaneFeatureData methods and properties to use with which types of reference planes.
