## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function SetReferenceAxes( _
   ByVal RetEntities As System.Object _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IPrimaryMemberRefPlaneFeatureData
Dim RetEntities As System.Object
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.SetReferenceAxes(RetEntities)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool SetReferenceAxes(
   System.object RetEntities
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool SetReferenceAxes(
   System.Object^ RetEntities
)
```

NOTE:

See

### Return Value

True if reference axes successfully set, false if not

## VBA Syntax

See

[PrimaryMemberRefPlaneFeatureData::SetReferenceAxes](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~PrimaryMemberRefPlaneFeatureData~SetReferenceAxes.html)

.

## Examples

See the

[IPrimaryMemberRefPlaneFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IPrimaryMemberRefPlaneFeatureData.html)

examples.

## Remarks

The number of members created = ([IPrimaryMemberRefPlaneFeatureData::GetReferenceAxes](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IPrimaryMemberRefPlaneFeatureData~GetReferenceAxes.html)*[IPrimaryMemberRefPlaneFeatureData::GetReferenceLocations](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IPrimaryMemberRefPlaneFeatureData~GetReferenceLocations.html))

During:

- creation, you can set any number of entities that are intersecting with the start and end reference (

  [IPrimaryMemberRefPlaneFeatureData::GetStartAndEndReferences](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IPrimaryMemberRefPlaneFeatureData~GetStartAndEndReferences.html)

  ).
- editing, you can set only one entity that intersects with the start and end reference.
