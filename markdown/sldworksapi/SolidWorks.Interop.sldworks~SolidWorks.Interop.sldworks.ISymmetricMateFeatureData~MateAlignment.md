# MateAlignment Property (ISymmetricMateFeatureData)

Gets or sets the alignment of this symmetry mate.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property MateAlignment As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISymmetricMateFeatureData
Dim value As System.Integer

instance.MateAlignment = value

value = instance.MateAlignment
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int MateAlignment {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.int MateAlignment {
   System.int get();
   void set (    System.int value);
}
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Property Value

Mate alignment as defined in

[swMateAlign_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SolidWorks.Interop.swconst~SolidWorks.Interop.swconst.swMateAlign_e.html)

## VBA Syntax

See

[SymmetricMateFeatureData::MateAlignment](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISymmetricMateFeatureData~MateAlignment.html)

.

## Examples

See the

[ISymmetricMateFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISymmetricMateFeatureData.html)

examples.

## Remarks

If this property is set to swMateAlign_e:

- swMateAlignALIGNED, then vectors normal to the selected entities point in the same direction.
- swMateAlignANTI_ALIGNED, then vectors normal to the selected entities point in opposite directions.
