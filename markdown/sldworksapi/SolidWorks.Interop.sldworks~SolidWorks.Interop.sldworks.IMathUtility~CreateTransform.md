# CreateTransform Method (IMathUtility)

Creates a new math transform.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function CreateTransform( _
   ByVal ArrayDataIn As System.Object _
) As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IMathUtility
Dim ArrayDataIn As System.Object
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.CreateTransform(ArrayDataIn)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object CreateTransform(
   System.object ArrayDataIn
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ CreateTransform(
   System.Object^ ArrayDataIn
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `ArrayDataIn`: Sixteen (16) components of the transform (see**Remarks**)

### Return Value

Newly created[math transform](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IMathTransform.html)or nothing or null if the operation fails

## VBA Syntax

## Remarks

Transformation matrix data:

|a b c . n |

|d e f . o |

|g h i . p |

|j k l . m |

The SOLIDWORKS transformation matrix is stored as a homogeneous matrix of 16 elements, ordered as shown. The first 9 elements(a to i)are elements of a 3x3 rotational sub-matrix, the next 3 elements(j,k,l)define a translation vector, and the next 1 element(m)is a scaling factor. The last 3 elements(n,o,p)are unused in this context.

The 3x3 rotational sub-matrix represents 3 axis sets:

- row 1 for x-axis components of rotation
- row 2 for y-axis components of rotation
- row 3 for z-axis components of rotation

The 3 axes are constrained to be orthogonal and unified so that they produce a pure rotational transformation. Reflections can also be added to these axes by setting the components to negative. The rotation sub-matrix coupled with the lower-left translation vector and the lower-right corner scaling factor creates an affine transformation, which is a transformation that preserves lines and parallelism; i.e., maps parallel lines to parallel lines.

If the 3 axis sets of the 3x3 rotational sub-matrix are not orthogonal or unified, then they are automatically corrected according to the following rules:

- If any axis is 0, or any two axes are parallel, or all axes are coplanar, then an identity matrix replaces the rotational sub-matrix.
- All axes are corrected to be of unit length.
- The axes are built to be orthogonal to each other in the prioritized order of Z, X, Y (X is orthogonal to Z, Y is orthogonal to Z and X).
