## VBA Syntax

See

[SketchHatch::DeSelect](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~SketchHatch~DeSelect.html)

.

## Remarks

This method does not work well when a PropertyManager page is open or a command is running. Use[IModelDoc2::DeSelectByID](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~DeSelectByID.html)instead of using this method. IModelDoc2::DeSelectByID handles selection correctly whether or not a command is running.

To select or deselect a sketch hatch, the owning document of the ISketchHatch object needs to be open and visible.

ISketchHatch selections are accessible through the[ISelectionMgr](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISelectionMgr.html)of the owning document of the[ISketchHatch](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchHatch.html)object, even if the owning document is not active.

Selection or deselection does not work for a sketch hatch in a component within an assembly. Selection or deselection does not work for a sketch hatch in a document within a drawing. Selection or deselection of sketch hatches owned by the top-level assembly or drawing works, but only if the assembly document or the drawing document is active.

If the owning sketch of a sketch hatch is active (inactive) when the sketch hatch is obtained, then it must be active (inactive) to deselect it. For example, if the owning sketch of a sketch hatch was active when the sketch hatch was obtained, then the owning sketch must be active to select or deselect the sketch hatch. Likewise, if the owning sketch of a sketch hatch was inactive when the sketch hatch was obtained, then the owning sketch must be inactive to select or deselect the sketch hatch.
