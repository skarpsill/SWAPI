# IGetTableThicknesses Method (IBaseFlangeFeatureData)

Gets the names of the thicknesses from the gauge table for this base flange feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetTableThicknesses( _
   ByVal NCount As System.Integer _
) As System.String
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IBaseFlangeFeatureData
Dim NCount As System.Integer
Dim value As System.String

value = instance.IGetTableThicknesses(NCount)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.string IGetTableThicknesses(
   System.int NCount
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.String^ IGetTableThicknesses(
   System.int NCount
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `NCount`: Number of thickness names

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of names of the thicknesses

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

## Remarks

Before calling this method, call[IBaseFlangeFeatureData::GetTableThicknessesCount](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IBaseFlangeFeatureData~GetTableThicknessesCount.html)to get the value for NCount.
