```vb
Function CreateArcDB( _
   ByVal X1 As System.Double, _
   ByVal Y1 As System.Double, _
   ByVal Z1 As System.Double, _
   ByVal X2 As System.Double, _
   ByVal Y2 As System.Double, _
   ByVal Z2 As System.Double, _
   ByVal X3 As System.Double, _
   ByVal Y3 As System.Double, _
   ByVal Z3 As System.Double, _
   ByVal Dir As System.Short _
) As System.Boolean
