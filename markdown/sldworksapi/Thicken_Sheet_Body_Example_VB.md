# Thicken Sheet Body Example (VBA)

This example shows how to thicken a sheet (surface) body.

```
'--------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open a part that contains a sheet body.
' 2. Select the sheet body in the Surface Bodies folder.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Thickens the sheet body and creates a temporary
'    thickened body.
' 2. Examine the FeatureManager design tree and
'    graphics area.
