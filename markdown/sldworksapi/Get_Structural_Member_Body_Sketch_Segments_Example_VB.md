# Get Structural Member Body Sketch Segments Example (VBA)

This example shows how to get the sketch segments that define the path of a
body in a structural member.

```vb
 '----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
 ' 1. Open public_documents\samples\tutorial\api\weldment_box3.sldprt.
 ' 2. Open the Immediate window.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1. Gets the feature definition of Structural Member1.
 ' 2. Selects body, Structural Member1[1].
 ' 3. Gets the number of sketch segments that define the path of the
 '    selected body.
 ' 4. Examine the Immediate window.
 '
 ' NOTE: Because the part is used elsewhere, do not save changes.

     Set swBody = selMan.GetSelectedObject6(1, -1)

    ' Get the sketch segments that define the path of the selected body
     vSeg = featData.GetSketchSegments(swBody)
     Debug.Print " Number of sketch segments: " & UBound(vSeg) + 1
End Sub
