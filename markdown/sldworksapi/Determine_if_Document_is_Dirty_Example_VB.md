# Determine if Document is Dirty Example (VBA)

This example shows how to determine if a document is dirty (i.e., modified
since opening it) and needs
to be saved.

```

' Preconditions:
' 1. Open multiple model documents.
' 2. Modify one of the model documents.
' 3. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Traverses the open model documents and checks
'    to see if they're dirty.
' 2. Examine the Immediate window.
'------------------------------------------------
Option Explicit
```

```
Sub main()
```

```
    Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks
    Dim swModel As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
```

```
    Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
    Set swModel = swApp.GetFirstDocument
```

```
    Do While Not swModel Is Nothing
        Debug.Print swModel.GetPathName
        Debug.Print "  Dirty? " & swModel.GetSaveFlag
        Set swModel = swModel.GetNext
    Loop
```

```
End Sub
```
