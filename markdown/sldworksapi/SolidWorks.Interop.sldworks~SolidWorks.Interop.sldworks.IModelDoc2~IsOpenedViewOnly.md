## VBA Syntax

.

## Remarks

Files are loaded using multi-threading. When a file is loading, the graphics are displayed immediately and the end-user is able to perform certain view zooming and panning functions. Until all data and references are loaded, the file is in view-only mode.

A file can be in view-only mode if the end-user chose to load the file for viewing purposes. You application should check for view-only mode to determine how to proceed.

NOTE:When a file is in view-only mode, many API queries return NULL or empty data.
