# IGetArcAtIndex Method (INote)

Gets information for the specified arc in this note.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetArcAtIndex( _
   ByVal Index As System.Integer _
) As System.Double
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As INote
Dim Index As System.Integer
Dim value As System.Double

value = instance.IGetArcAtIndex(Index)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.double IGetArcAtIndex(
   System.int Index
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.double IGetArcAtIndex(
   System.int Index
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Index`: Index of the desired arc where the index begins at 0

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of doubles (see

  Remarks

  )
- VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

## Remarks

Call[INote::GetArcCount](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.INote~GetArcCount.html)before calling this method to determine the size of the return array.

Return value is an array of doubles:

[LineType, StartPt[3], EndPt[3], CenterPt[3], RotDir]

where :

(Table)=========================================================

| LineType | Line type. Valid returns are defined in swLineTypes_e . A LineType is a combination of a line style and line weight. |
| --- | --- |
| StartPt[3] | Array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the start point. |
| EndPt[3] | Array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the end point. If the arc is closed, then this is the same point as the StartPt . |
| CenterPt[3] | Array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the center point. |
| RotDir | Rotational direction (CW = -1, CCW = 1) |

The data returned from this method is in terms of document apace.

(Table)=========================================================

| If the document containing this note is... | Then the coordinates returned are based on the... |

| Drawing | Sheet origin |
| Part or assembly | Model origin |
