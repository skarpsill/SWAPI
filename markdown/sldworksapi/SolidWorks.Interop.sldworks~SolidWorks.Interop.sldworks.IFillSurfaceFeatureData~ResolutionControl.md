# ResolutionControl Property (IFillSurfaceFeatureData)

Gets and sets the quality of the resolution of the fill-surface feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property ResolutionControl As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFillSurfaceFeatureData
Dim value As System.Integer

instance.ResolutionControl = value

value = instance.ResolutionControl
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int ResolutionControl {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.int ResolutionControl {
   System.int get();
   void set (    System.int value);
}
```

NOTE:

See

### Property Value

Valid values: 1, 2, and 3 (see

Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

See

[FillSurfaceFeatureData::ResolutionControl](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~FillSurfaceFeatureData~ResolutionControl.html)

.

## Examples

[Insert Fill-surface Feature (C#)](Insert_Fill-surface_Feature_Example_CSharp.htm)

[Insert Fill-surface Feature (VB.NET)](Insert_Fill-surface_Feature_Example_VBNET.htm)

[Insert Fill-surface Feature (VBA)](Insert_Fill-surface_Feature_Example_VB.htm)

## Remarks

Adjusting the quality of the resolution is only available for patches that are not optimized. See[IFillSurfaceFeatureData::OptimizeSurface](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFillSurfaceFeatureData~OptimizeSurface.html)for details.

Specifying a higher value:

- Increases the number of patches defining the surface
- Improves the quality of the surface profile
- Increases processing time
- Increases the size of the file
