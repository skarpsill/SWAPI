# GetNextFace Method (IMidSurface3)

Gets the next neutral face in this midsurface feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetNextFace( _
   ByRef FromFace1Disp As System.Object, _
   ByRef FromFace2Disp As System.Object, _
   ByRef Thickness As System.Double _
) As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IMidSurface3
Dim FromFace1Disp As System.Object
Dim FromFace2Disp As System.Object
Dim Thickness As System.Double
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.GetNextFace(FromFace1Disp, FromFace2Disp, Thickness)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object GetNextFace(
   out System.object FromFace1Disp,
   out System.object FromFace2Disp,
   out System.double Thickness
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ GetNextFace(
   [Out] System.Object^ FromFace1Disp,
   [Out] System.Object^ FromFace2Disp,
   [Out] System.double Thickness
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `FromFace1Disp`: [Face](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFace2.html)

on the original part body used in generating the neutral face
- `FromFace2Disp`: [Face](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFace2.html)

on the original part body used in generating the neutral face
- `Thickness`: Distance between the two parallel faces, FromFace1Disp and FromFace2Disp

### Return Value

[Face](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFace2.html)

in this midsurface feature

## VBA Syntax

See

[MidSurface3::GetNextFace](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~MidSurface3~GetNextFace.html)

.

## Remarks

Call[IMidSurface3::GetFirstFace](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IMidSurface3~GetFirstFace.html)before calling this method to get the first neutral face.

This method returns the next neutral face in this midsurface feature along with three other items.

- The first two return values are the two faces from the original part body that were used to generate this neutral midsurface face.
- The next return value is the thickness (in meters) between the two parallel faces from the original part body.
- The last return value is the neutral face in this midsurface feature.
