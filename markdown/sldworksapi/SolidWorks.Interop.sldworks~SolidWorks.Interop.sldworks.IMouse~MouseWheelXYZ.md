# MouseWheelXYZ Method (IMouse)

Zoom in or zoom out using the mouse.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function MouseWheelXYZ( _
   ByVal X As System.Double, _
   ByVal Y As System.Double, _
   ByVal Z As System.Double, _
   ByVal Clicks As System.Integer, _
   ByVal Flags As System.Integer _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IMouse
Dim X As System.Double
Dim Y As System.Double
Dim Z As System.Double
Dim Clicks As System.Integer
Dim Flags As System.Integer
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.MouseWheelXYZ(X, Y, Z, Clicks, Flags)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool MouseWheelXYZ(
   System.double X,
   System.double Y,
   System.double Z,
   System.int Clicks,
   System.int Flags
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool MouseWheelXYZ(
   System.double X,
   System.double Y,
   System.double Z,
   System.int Clicks,
   System.int Flags
)
```

## Examples

**Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)**

'--------------------------------
' Preconditions: Model document is open.
' ' Postconditions: Model is zoomed in and out.
'--------------------------------

Option Explicit

Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorksDim swModel As SldWorks.ModelDoc2 Dim swModelView As SldWorks.ModelView Dim swMouse As SldWorks.Mouse

Sub main()

Set swApp = Application.SldWorks Set swModel = swApp. ActiveDoc Set swModelView = swModel. ActiveView Set swMouse = swModelView. GetMouse

swMouse. MouseWheelXYZ 0, 0, 0, 120, swMouse_RightUp swMouse. MouseWheelXYZ 0, 0, 0, 120, swMouse_RightUp swMouse. MouseWheelXYZ 0, 0, 0, 240, swMouse_RightUp swMouse. MouseWheelXYZ 0, 0, 0, -120, swMouse_RightUp swMouse. MouseWheelXYZ 0, 0, 0, -240, swMouse_RightUp

End Sub

## Remarks

To use this method and access SOLIDWORKS commands, you must add a reference toSOLIDWORKS`version`Commands type library(substitute the actual SOLIDWORKS version number for`version`) or**SolidWorks.Interop.swcommands.dll**, typically installed in`install_dir`**\api\redist.**

The coordinate system is the model's coordinate system.
