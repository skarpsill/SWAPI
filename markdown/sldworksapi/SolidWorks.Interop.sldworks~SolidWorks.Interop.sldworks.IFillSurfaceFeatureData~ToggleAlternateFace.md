# ToggleAlternateFace Method (IFillSurfaceFeatureData)

Switches the boundary face of the curvature control of the patch.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function ToggleAlternateFace() As Face2
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFillSurfaceFeatureData
Dim value As Face2

value = instance.ToggleAlternateFace()
```

### C#

```csharp
Face2 ToggleAlternateFace()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Face2^ ToggleAlternateFace();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

Pointer to the new boundary face,

[IFace2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFace2.html)

object

## VBA Syntax

See

[FillSurfaceFeatureData::ToggleAlternateFace](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~FillSurfaceFeatureData~ToggleAlternateFace.html)

.

## Remarks

This method is valid only when the contact type is tangent and edges are used to define the patch boundary. Use[IFillSurfaceFeatureData::GetCurvatureControl](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFillSurfaceFeatureData~GetCurvatureControl.html)to determine the contact type.

See[Accessing Selections that Define Features](sldworksAPIProgGuide.chm::/Miscellaneous/Accessing_Selections_that_Define_Features.htm)for additional details on using this method.
