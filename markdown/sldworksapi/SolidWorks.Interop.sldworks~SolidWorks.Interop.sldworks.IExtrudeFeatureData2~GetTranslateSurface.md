Function GetTranslateSurface( _
   ByVal Fwd As System.Boolean _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IExtrudeFeatureData2
Dim Fwd As System.Boolean
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.GetTranslateSurface(Fwd)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool GetTranslateSurface(
   System.bool Fwd
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool GetTranslateSurface(
   System.bool Fwd
)
```

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Fwd`: True makes the end of the extrusion a translation of the reference surface in the forward direction, false makes the end of the extrusion a translation of the reference surface in the reverse direction

### Return Value
