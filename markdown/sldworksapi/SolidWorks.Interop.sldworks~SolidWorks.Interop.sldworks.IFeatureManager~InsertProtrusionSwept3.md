### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function InsertProtrusionSwept3( _
   ByVal Propagate As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal Alignment As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal TwistCtrlOption As System.Short, _
   ByVal KeepTangency As System.Boolean, _

Dim PathAlign As System.Short
Dim Merge As System.Boolean
Dim UseFeatScope As System.Boolean
Dim UseAutoSelect As System.Boolean
Dim TwistAngle As System.Double
Dim BMergeSmoothFaces As System.Boolean
Dim value As Feature

value = instance.InsertProtrusionSwept3(Propagate, Alignment, TwistCtrlOption, KeepTangency, BAdvancedSmoothing, StartMatchingType, EndMatchingType, IsThinBody, Thickness1, Thickness2, ThinType, PathAlign, Merge, UseFeatScope, UseAutoSelect, TwistAngle, BMergeSmoothFaces)
```

### C#

```csharp
Feature InsertProtrusionSwept3(
   System.bool Propagate,

)
```

.

### Parameters

- `Propagate`: True propagates the swept protrusion to the next tangent edge, false does not
- `Alignment`: True causes the swept protrusion to go through the end faces if the curve used for the sweep goes from one face to another or from one edge to another, false causes the swept protrusion to begin and end perpendicular to the sweep curve and it cannot break through the two end faces of the body
- `TwistCtrlOption`: Twist control options as defined in

[swTwistControlType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swTwistControlType_e.html)
- `KeepTangency`: If the sweep section has tangent segments, then true to cause the corresponding surfaces in the resulting sweep to be tangent, false to not
- `BAdvancedSmoothing`: If the sweep section has circular or elliptical arcs, then true to approximate the sections and smooth the surfaces, false to not
- `StartMatchingType`: Tangency type as defined in

[swTangencyType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swTangencyType_e.html)
- `EndMatchingType`: Tangency type as defined in

[swTangencyType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swTangencyType_e.html)
- `IsThinBody`: True if this feature is a thin body, false if not
- `Thickness1`: Thickness value for the first direction
- `Thickness2`: Thickness value for the second direction
- `ThinType`: Thin wall type as defined in

[swThinWallType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swThinWallType_e.html)
- `PathAlign`: Align path type (see

Remarks

)
- `Merge`: True to merge the results in a multibody part, false to not
- `UseFeatScope`: True if the feature only affects selected bodies, false if the feature affects all bodies
- `UseAutoSelect`: True to automatically select all bodies and have the feature affect those bodies, false to select the bodies the feature affects (see

Remarks

)
- `TwistAngle`: If TwistCtrlOption set to swTwistControlType_e.swTwistControlConstantTwistAlongPath, then specify end twist angle
- `BMergeSmoothFaces`: True to merge smooth faces, false to not

### Return Value

Pointer to the

[IFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature.html)

object

## VBA Syntax

See

[FeatureManager::InsertProtrusionSwept3](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~FeatureManager~InsertProtrusionSwept3.html)

.

## Remarks

Use[IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~SelectByID2.html)to select the profile and sweep curves. The mark for:

- 1 = Profile selection
- 2 = Guide curve selection, if provided
- 4 = Sweep path

The PathAlign argument is available when TwistCtrlOption is set to 0 (follow path) and can take one of these values:

- 0 = None; no correction (default)
- 2 = Direction vector; a plane, planar face, or line defines the path
- 3 = All faces; includes neighboring faces

When UseAutoSelect is false, the user must select the bodies that the feature will affect.
