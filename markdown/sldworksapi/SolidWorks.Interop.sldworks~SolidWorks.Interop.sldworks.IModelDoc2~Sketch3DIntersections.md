# Sketch3DIntersections Method (IModelDoc2)

Creates new sketch segments based on the selected surfaces.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub Sketch3DIntersections()
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IModelDoc2

instance.Sketch3DIntersections()
```

### C#

```csharp
void Sketch3DIntersections()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void Sketch3DIntersections();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

## VBA Syntax

See

[ModelDoc2::Sketch3DIntersections](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~ModelDoc2~Sketch3DIntersections.html)

.

## Remarks

The new sketch segments are added either to the active sketch or to an appropriate new sketch.

If the active sketch is a 2D sketch and the intersection curves are not in that plane, then the resulting sketch segments are projected onto the plane of the sketch.
