# GetSmartComponentData Method (IComponent2)

Gets the features, components, and feature references of a Smart Component.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetSmartComponentData( _
   ByRef Features As System.Object, _
   ByRef FeaturesSelected As System.Object, _
   ByRef Components As System.Object, _
   ByRef ComponentsSelected As System.Object, _
   ByRef References As System.Object _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IComponent2
Dim Features As System.Object
Dim FeaturesSelected As System.Object
Dim Components As System.Object
Dim ComponentsSelected As System.Object
Dim References As System.Object
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.GetSmartComponentData(Features, FeaturesSelected, Components, ComponentsSelected, References)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool GetSmartComponentData(
   out System.object Features,
   out System.object FeaturesSelected,
   out System.object Components,
   out System.object ComponentsSelected,
   out System.object References
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool GetSmartComponentData(
   [Out] System.Object^ Features,
   [Out] System.Object^ FeaturesSelected,
   [Out] System.Object^ Components,
   [Out] System.Object^ ComponentsSelected,
   [Out] System.Object^ References
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Features`: Array of

[IFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature.html)

s that can be selected for this Smart Component (see

Remarks

)
- `FeaturesSelected`: Array of boolean values; true if the corresponding item in the Features array is selected, false if it is not selected
- `Components`: Array of

[IComponent2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IComponent2.html)

s that can be selected for this Smart Component (see

Remarks

)
- `ComponentsSelected`: Array of boolean values; true if the corresponding item in the Components array is selected, false if it is not selected
- `References`: Array of feature reference entities that are used to activate the Smart Features specified by Features and FeaturesSelected; empty if the Smart Component features have not been activated (see

Remarks

)

### Return Value

True if successful, false if not

## VBA Syntax

[Activate Smart Features in an Assembly (C#)](Activate_Smart_Features_in_an_Assembly_Example_CSharp.htm)

## Remarks

A Smart Component is defined by:

- Components
- Features
- Feature references

See the SOLIDWORKS Help for more information about Smart Components.

Use this method to get the current features, components, and feature references of a Smart Component.

Before calling this method:

1. Open an assembly that contains a Smart Component whose Smart Features are not activated.
2. Find the Smart Component in the assembly using

  [IComponent2::IsSmartComponent](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IComponent2~IsSmartComponent.html)

  .

After calling this method, use[IComponent2::SetSmartComponentData](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IComponent2~SetSmartComponentData.html)to change which features and components of a Smart Component to enable and which Smart Features to activate.

Use[ISmartComponentFeatureData](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISmartComponentFeatureData.html)to:

- Insert new features and components into a Smart Component.
- Delete features and components from a Smart Component.
