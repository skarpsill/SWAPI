## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetViewRotation() As System.Double
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IAnnotationView
Dim value As System.Double

value = instance.IGetViewRotation()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.double IGetViewRotation()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.double IGetViewRotation();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of 9 doubles of the rotation matrix of the annotation view relative to the X-Y plane of the model

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported
