## VBA Syntax

See

[SldWorks::CheckpointConvertedDocument](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~SldWorks~CheckpointConvertedDocument.html)

.

## Remarks

This saves the document even if the document is read-only.

This method requires that the document is currently open in your SOLIDWORKS session. It specifically checks if the document has been upgraded to the current version of thekadov_tag{{</spaces>}}SOLIDWORKS product in this session. If it has not, then this method has no effect.

Be careful when using this method because this method attempts to change the file permissions to read-write if the file is read-only, and if successful , itkadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}overwrites the file and restores the permission to read-only. Although it may appear the file is safe because it is read-only before and after the operation, it might have been overwritten by this method.

This method was designed to be used with the ISldWorks event[DocumentConversionNotify](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.DSldWorksEvents_DocumentConversionNotifyEventHandler.html). It does not require that the notification be used, but it should work in response to that notification.
