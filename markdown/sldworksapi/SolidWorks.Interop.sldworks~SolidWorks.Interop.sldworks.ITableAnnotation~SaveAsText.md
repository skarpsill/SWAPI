)
- `Separator`: Character or string to use to separate each of the text within each of the cells in the table in the text file

### Return Value

True if table is saved as a text file, false if notParamDesc

## VBA Syntax

See

[TableAnnotation::SaveAsText](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~TableAnnotation~SaveAsText.html)

.

## Remarks

You must specify a filename. It should include the path, filename, and filename extension to which to save the table as a text file.

| If a file of the specified name in the specified path... | Then it is... |
| --- | --- |
| Exists | Overwritten |
| Does not exist | Created |

The Separator argument is typically a single character, but it can be a string. If Separator is empty, then the tab character is used.

**NOTE**: Although you can save a table as a text file for use with other applications like Microsoft Excel, you cannot currently import a text file to a table in SOLIDWORKS.
