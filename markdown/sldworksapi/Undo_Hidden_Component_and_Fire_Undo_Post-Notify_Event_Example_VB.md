# Undo Hidden Component and Fire Undo Post-Notify Event Example (VBA)

This example shows how to fire an undo post-notification in
an assembly document.

```
'--------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open public_documents\samples\tutorial\smartcomponents\stepped_shaft.sldasm.
' 2. Copy and paste Main into the main module.
' 3. Click Insert > Class Module and copy and paste Class1 into that module.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Selects and hides the base-plate<1> component.
' 2. Undoes the hiding of the base-plate<1> component.
' 3. Fires a post-notification indicating that an undo action occurred.
' 4. Click OK to close the message box.
'
' NOTE: Because the assembly is used elsewhere, do not save changes.

Dim swModel As SldWorks.ModelDoc2

    ' Select a component and hide it
    boolstatus = swModelDocExt.SelectByID2("base_plate-1@stepped_shaft", "COMPONENT", 0, 0, 0, False, 0, Nothing, 0)
    swModel.HideComponent2
```

```
    swModel.ClearSelection2 True
```

```
    ' Undo hiding of the component
