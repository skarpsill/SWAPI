# EnumEdges Method (ISketchText)

Gets the edges in this sketch text.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function EnumEdges() As EnumEdges
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISketchText
Dim value As EnumEdges

value = instance.EnumEdges()
```

### C#

```csharp
EnumEdges EnumEdges()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
EnumEdges^ EnumEdges();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

[Edges enumeration](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IEnumEdges.html)

## VBA Syntax

See

[SketchText::EnumEdges](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~SketchText~EnumEdges.html)

.

## Remarks

The edges returned by this method are transient and should be regarded as read only. They can be used to obtain the underlying[ICurve](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ICurve.html)objects, but should not be used for manipulation or to obtain any other objects through them. These pointers should not be saved; if they are needed again, they should be obtained at that time.
