# Select Face Using Intersecting Ray Example (VBA)

This example shows how to select the first face that is intersected by a ray
that starts at the specified point and runs parallel to the specified direction
vector within the specified radius.

```
'---------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open public_documents\samples\tutorial\api\box.sldrpt.
' 2. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Selects the first face intersected by a ray that starts
'    at the specified point and runs parallel to the specified
'    direction vector within the specified radius.
' 2. Examine the graphics area and Immediate window.
