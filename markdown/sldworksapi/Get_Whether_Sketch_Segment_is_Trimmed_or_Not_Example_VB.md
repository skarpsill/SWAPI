# Get Whether Sketch Segment is Trimmed or Not Example (VBA)

This example shows how to determine if a sketch segment is trimmed or
not.

```
'---------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open a part that contains a 3D sketch containing
'    a sketch segment (i.e., line, arc, ellipse,
'    spline, or parabola).
' 2. Select the 3D sketch.
' 3. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Gets the sketch segment and its ID and type
'    and whether the sketch segment is construction
'    geometry and trimmed.
' 2. Examine the Immediate window.
'---------------------------------------------
