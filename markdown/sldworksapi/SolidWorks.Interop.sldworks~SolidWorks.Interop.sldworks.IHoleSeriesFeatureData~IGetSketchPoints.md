# IGetSketchPoints Method (IHoleSeriesFeatureData)

Obsolete. Superseded by[IHoleSeriesFeatureData2::IGetSketchPoints](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IHoleSeriesFeatureData2~IGetSketchPoints.html).

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetSketchPoints( _
   ByVal NCount As System.Integer _
) As SketchPoint
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IHoleSeriesFeatureData
Dim NCount As System.Integer
Dim value As SketchPoint

value = instance.IGetSketchPoints(NCount)
```

### C#

```csharp
SketchPoint IGetSketchPoints(
   System.int NCount
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
SketchPoint^ IGetSketchPoints(
   System.int NCount
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `NCount`: Number of center-hole sketch points

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of center-hole

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

## Remarks

Before calling this method, call

[IHoleSeriesFeatureData::GetSketchPointsCount](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IHoleSeriesFeatureData~GetSketchPointsCount.html)

to get the value for NCount.
