   ref Body2 SectionedBodies
)
```

### C++/CLI

.

### Parameters

- `Sheet`: Pointer to the sheet body used to perform the section

## VBA Syntax

See

[Body2::ISectionBySheet](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Body2~ISectionBySheet.html)

.

## Remarks

Before using this method,

[make a copy of the body](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IBody2~Copy.html)

because the sheet body becomes invalid after using this method. COM applications should release all bodies after calling this method.
