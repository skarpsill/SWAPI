Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.ChangeStandard(Standard, FastenerType, SSize)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool ChangeStandard(

   System.int FastenerType,
   System.string SSize
)
```

### Parameters

- `Standard`: Standard as defined in

[swWzdHoleStandards_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swWzdHoleStandards_e.html)
- `FastenerType`: Fastener type as defined in

[swWzdHoleStandardFastenerTypes_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swWzdHoleStandardFastenerTypes_e.html)
- `SSize`: Fastener size

## VBA Syntax

See

[WizardHoleFeatureData2::ChangeStandard](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~WizardHoleFeatureData2~ChangeStandard.html)

.

## Remarks

Use this method to change[fastener size](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IWizardHoleFeatureData2~FastenerSize.html),[fastener type](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IWizardHoleFeatureData2~FastenerType2.html), and[design standard](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IWizardHoleFeatureData2~Standard2.html)of a Hole Wizard feature.

If changing the standard requires you to change the type, then you must call[IWizardHoleFeatureData2::Type](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IWizardHoleFeatureData2~Type.html)before calling IWizardHoleFeatureData2::ChangeStandard.
