## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISldWorks
Dim value As System.String

value = instance.GetCurrentWorkingDirectory()
```

### C#

```csharp

```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.String^ GetCurrentWorkingDirectory();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

Current working directory with trailing backslash

## VBA Syntax

See

[SldWorks::GetCurrentWorkingDirectory](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~SldWorks~GetCurrentWorkingDirectory.html)

.

## Remarks

The current working directory is used when opening documents containing references. If explicit search folders are not set (see[ISldWorks::SetSearchFolders](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~SetSearchFolders.html)), then the SOLIDWORKS application initially tries to locate file references (for example, assembly component parts) in the current working directory. Interactively, the current working directory is used by theFile Opendialog and is set when you choose theOpendialog button.

The most current[ISldWorks::OpenDoc6](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~OpenDoc6.html)method does not set the current working directory. Therefore, you might want to set the current working directory programmatically (see[ISldWorks::SetCurrentWorkingDirectory](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~SetCurrentWorkingDirectory.html)) before opening a file containing references. By doing this, your application behaves as if the file was opened interactively using the File Open dialog.

For more information on the search criteria used by the SOLIDWORKS application when loading file references, see SOLIDWORKS Help.
