# AddVariablePitchHelixSegment Method (IFeatureManager)

Adds a segment to a variable-pitch helix.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function AddVariablePitchHelixSegment( _
   ByVal Height As System.Double, _
   ByVal Diameter As System.Double, _
   ByVal Pitch As System.Double _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeatureManager
Dim Height As System.Double
Dim Diameter As System.Double
Dim Pitch As System.Double
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.AddVariablePitchHelixSegment(Height, Diameter, Pitch)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool AddVariablePitchHelixSegment(
   System.double Height,
   System.double Diameter,
   System.double Pitch
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool AddVariablePitchHelixSegment(
   System.double Height,
   System.double Diameter,
   System.double Pitch
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Height`: Helix segment revolution; 1.0 = 360 degrees

begin!kadov{{

}}end!kadov
- `Diameter`: Diameter, which determines how far the variable-pitch helix segment extends
- `Pitch`: Pitch, which determines the width of one complete helix turn, measured parallel to the axis of the helix

### Return Value

True if the variable-pitch helix segment is added, false if not

## VBA Syntax

## Remarks

To create and insert a variable-pitch helix, call:

1. [IFeatureManager::InsertVariablePitchHelix](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~InsertVariablePitchHelix.html)

  to create it.
2. [IFeatureManager::AddVariablePitchHelixFirstPitchAndDiameter](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~AddVariablePitchHelixFirstPitchAndDiameter.html)

  to add the first segment.
3. IFeatureManager::AddVariablePitchHelixSegment one or more times to add the remaining segments.
4. [IFeatureManager::EndVariablePitchHelix](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~EndVariablePitchHelix.html)

  to insert it.
