# ICurveDrivenPatternFeatureData Interface

Allows access to a curve-driven pattern feature.

**NOTE:**Click the**Members**link, located near the top of the topic, to see this interface's methods and properties.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Public Interface ICurveDrivenPatternFeatureData
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICurveDrivenPatternFeatureData
```

### C#

```csharp
public interface ICurveDrivenPatternFeatureData
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
public interface class ICurveDrivenPatternFeatureData
```

## VBA Syntax

See

[CurveDrivenPatternFeatureData](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~CurveDrivenPatternFeatureData.html)

.

## Examples

[Create and Access Curve-driven Pattern Feature (C#)](Create_and_Access_Curve-driven_Pattern_Feature_Example_CSharp.htm)

[Create and Access Curve-driven Pattern Feature (VB.NET)](Create_and_Access_Curve-driven_Pattern_Feature_Example_VBNET.htm)

[Create and Access Curve-driven Pattern Feature (VBA)](Create_and_Access_Curve-driven_Pattern_Feature_Example_VB.htm)

## Remarks

Read[Pattern Features and their Feature Data Objects](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/Pattern_Features_and_their_Feature_Data_Objects.htm).

Before calling[IFeatureManager::CreateDefinition](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~CreateDefinition.html), you must pre-select the entities needed to create the curve-driven pattern feature.

| To select ... | Use Mark=... |
| --- | --- |
| Features to pattern | 4 |
| Direction 1 entity (2D/3D curve, edge, sketch, or sketch entity) | 1 |
| Direction 2 entity (2D/3D curve, edge, sketch, or sketch entity) | 2 |
| Face normal (face on which the Direction 1 3D curve lies); needed only when ICurveDrivenPatternFeatureData::D1AlignmentMethod is set to swCurveDrivenPatternAlignment_e .swCurvePatternTangentToCurve and Direction 1 is a 3D curve entity | 1024 |

After calling IFeatureManager::CreateDefinition, you can explicitly set other properties on the feature data object.

You must call[IFeatureManager::CreateFeature](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~CreateFeature.html)after initializing this feature data object in order to successfully create the curve-driven pattern feature.

For more information about curve-driven pattern features, see the**Parts and Features > Features > Patterns and Mirroring > Types of Patterns > Curve Driven Patterns and the Curve Driven Pattern PropertyManager**topic in the SOLIDWORKS user-interface help.
