# IImprintCurve Method (IFace2)

Imprints a curve on the selected face.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub IImprintCurve( _
   ByVal Curve As Curve, _
   ByVal NewEdgeCount As System.Integer, _
   ByRef NewEdges As Edge, _
   ByVal NewFaceCount As System.Integer, _
   ByRef NewFaces As Face2 _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFace2
Dim Curve As Curve
Dim NewEdgeCount As System.Integer
Dim NewEdges As Edge
Dim NewFaceCount As System.Integer
Dim NewFaces As Face2

instance.IImprintCurve(Curve, NewEdgeCount, NewEdges, NewFaceCount, NewFaces)
```

### C#

```csharp
void IImprintCurve(
   Curve Curve,
   System.int NewEdgeCount,
   out Edge NewEdges,
   System.int NewFaceCount,
   out Face2 NewFaces
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void IImprintCurve(
   Curve^ Curve,
   System.int NewEdgeCount,
   [Out] Edge^ NewEdges,
   System.int NewFaceCount,
   [Out] Face2^ NewFaces
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Curve`: Pointer to the

[curve](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ICurve.html)

to imprint on the face
- `NewEdgeCount`: Number of new edges to create
- `NewEdges`: Array of new[edges](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IEdge.html)created by the imprinted curveParamDescof size NewEdgeCount
- `NewFaceCount`: Number of new faces to createParamDesc
- `NewFaces`: Array of new[faces](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFace2.html)created by the imprinted curveParamDescof size NewFaceCount

## VBA Syntax

See

[Face2::IImprintCurve](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Face2~IImprintCurve.html)

.

## Remarks

Before calling this method, call[IFace2::ImprintCurveCount](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFace2~ImprintCurveCount.html)to get the size of the arrays.

The specified curve must lie on the face.

To imprint a curve on a new face of a temporary body, create a copy of the original curve and imprint the copy of the curve on the new face.
