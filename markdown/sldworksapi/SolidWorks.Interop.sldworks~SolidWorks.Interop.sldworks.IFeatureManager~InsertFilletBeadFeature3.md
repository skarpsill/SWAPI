   ByVal DeSelEdge2 As System.Object, _
   ByVal FaceSet1 As System.Object, _
   ByVal FaceSet2 As System.Object _
) As Feature
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeatureManager
Dim Type1 As System.Short

### Parameters

- `Type1`: First side:

- 0 = Full lengthParamDesc
- 1 = Intermittent
- 2 = Staggered
- `Size1`: Size of fillet on first side
- `Length1`: Length of fillet on first side
- `PenetrationType1`: First side:

- 0 = Full penetration
- 1 = Partial penetration
- 2 = No penetration
- `PenetrationValue1`: If penetrationType1 is set to 1 (Partial penetration), then set its value
- `Pitch`: Pitch, if Intermittent or Staggered on both sides
- `Type2`: Second side:

- 0= Full lengthParamDesc
- 1 = Intermittent
- 2= Staggered
- `Size2`: Size of fillet on second side
- `Length2`: Length of fillet on second side

ParamDesc
- `PenetrationType2`: Second side:

- 0 = Full penetration
- 1 = Partial penetration
- 2 = No penetration
- `PenetrationValue2`: If penetrationType2 is set to 1 (Partial penetration), then set its value
- `Flag`: - 0 = One-sided and no tangent propagation
- 1 = Two-sided
- 2 = Tangent propagation
- 3 = Two-sided and tangent propagation
- `EdgeNum1`: Number of intersecting edges on first side
- `DeSelEdge1`: Array indicating if intersecting edges are selected (0) or deselected (1) on first side
- `EdgeNum2`: Number of intersecting edges on second side
- `DeSelEdge2`: Array indicating if intersecting edges are selected (0) or deselected (1) on second side
- `FaceSet1`: Array of side 1

[faces](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFace2.html)

whose intersecting edges get fillet beads
- `FaceSet2`: Array of side 2

[faces](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFace2.html)

whose intersecting edges get fillet beads

### Return Value

[Feature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature.html)

## VBA Syntax

See

[FeatureManager::InsertFilletBeadFeature3](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~FeatureManager~InsertFilletBeadFeature3.html)

.

## Remarks

This interface specifies two face arrays, one for each side of a part feature. The fillet bead is applied to the edges where each face intersects for each array specified.
