# GetFeatureCount Method (IModelDoc2)

Gets the number of features in this document.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetFeatureCount() As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IModelDoc2
Dim value As System.Integer

value = instance.GetFeatureCount()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int GetFeatureCount()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.int GetFeatureCount();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

Number of features in this document; this number does not include subfeatures

## VBA Syntax

See

[ModelDoc2::GetFeatureCount](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~ModelDoc2~GetFeatureCount.html)

## Remarks

The number of features returned by this method doeskadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}not include subfeatures. Subfeatures include, for example, mate features within a mategroup, drawing views on a sheet, and so on. One way to identify a subfeature is whether it can be returned by:

- [IFeature::GetFirstSubFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetFirstSubFeature.html)

  or

  [IFeature::IGetFirstSubFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~IGetFirstSubFeature.html)
- [IFeature::GetNextSubFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetNextSubFeature.html)

  or

  [IFeature::IGetNextSubFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~IGetNextSubFeature.html)

  .

This method returns the number of features returned when traversing the Feature list with[IModelDoc2::FirstFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~FirstFeature.html)or[IModelDoc2::IFirstFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~IFirstFeature.html)and[IFeature::GetNextFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetNextFeature.html)or[IFeature::IGetNextFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~IGetNextFeature.html). This value may be useful in feature traversal or if accessing the feature by position using[IModelDoc2::FeatureByPositionReverse](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~FeatureByPositionReverse.html)or[IModelDoc2::IFeatureByPositionReverse](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~IFeatureByPositionReverse.html).
