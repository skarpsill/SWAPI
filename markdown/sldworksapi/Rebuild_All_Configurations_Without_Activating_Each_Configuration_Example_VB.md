# Rebuild All Configurations Without Activating Each Configuration Example (VBA)

This example shows how to rebuild only those features that need to be rebuilt in all configurations without
activating each configuration.

```
'-------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open public_documents\samples\tutorial\pdmworks\speaker.sldasm.
' 2. Right-click membrane<1> and click Suppress in the active
'    configuration, Dual Speaker.
' 3. Click Don't Save.
' 4. Click the ConfigurationManager tab and right-click Single
'    Speaker Glueable and click Show Configuration to make this
'    configuration the active configuration.
' 5. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Gets whether each configuration needs to be rebuilt.
' 2. Rebuilds only those features that need to be rebuilt in all
'    configurations without activating each configuration.
' 3. Gets whether each configuration needs to be rebuilt.
' 4. Examine the Immediate window.
'
' NOTE: Because the assembly is used elsewhere, do not save changes.
