# GetEdges Method (ISketchText)

Obsolete. Superseded by

[ISketchText::GetEdges2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISketchText~GetEdges2.html)

.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetEdges() As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISketchText
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.GetEdges()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object GetEdges()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ GetEdges();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

Array of

[edges](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IEdge.html)

## VBA Syntax

See

[SketchText::GetEdges](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~SketchText~GetEdges.html)

.

## Remarks

The edges returned by this method are transient and should be regarded as read only. They can be used to obtain the underlying[ICurve](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ICurve.html)objects, but should not be used for manipulation or to obtain any other objects through them. These pointers should not be saved; if they are needed again, they should be obtained at that time.
