# FeatureCutThicken Method (IFeatureManager)

Thickens the selected reference surface feature, and then generates a cut.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function FeatureCutThicken( _
   ByVal Thickness As System.Double, _
   ByVal Direction As System.Integer, _
   ByVal FaceIndex As System.Integer, _
   ByVal FillVolume As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal UseFeatScope As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal UseAutoSelect As System.Boolean _
) As Feature
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeatureManager
Dim Thickness As System.Double
Dim Direction As System.Integer
Dim FaceIndex As System.Integer
Dim FillVolume As System.Boolean
Dim UseFeatScope As System.Boolean
Dim UseAutoSelect As System.Boolean
Dim value As Feature

value = instance.FeatureCutThicken(Thickness, Direction, FaceIndex, FillVolume, UseFeatScope, UseAutoSelect)
```

### C#

```csharp
Feature FeatureCutThicken(
   System.double Thickness,
   System.int Direction,
   System.int FaceIndex,
   System.bool FillVolume,
   System.bool UseFeatScope,
   System.bool UseAutoSelect
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Feature^ FeatureCutThicken(
   System.double Thickness,
   System.int Direction,
   System.int FaceIndex,
   System.bool FillVolume,
   System.bool UseFeatScope,
   System.bool UseAutoSelect
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Thickness`: Wall thickness
- `Direction`: - 0 = Thicken side 1
- 1 = Thicken side 2
- 2 = Thicken both sides
- `FaceIndex`: Not currently used
- `FillVolume`: True to make the solid from a knitted surface, false to not (see**Remarks**)
- `UseFeatScope`: True if the feature only affects selected bodies, false if the feature affects all bodies
- `UseAutoSelect`: True to automatically select all bodies and have the feature affectkadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}those bodies, false to select the bodies the feature affects (seeRemarks)

### Return Value

Pointer to the[IFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature.html)object

## VBA Syntax

See

[FeatureManager::FeatureCutThicken](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~FeatureManager~FeatureCutThicken.html)

.

## Remarks

This method creates a cut feature by thickening a selected reference surface. If FillVolume is True, other arguments are ignored. A closed surface is required when FillVolume is True.

When UseAutoSelect is false, the user must select the bodies that the feature will affect.

When using cut or cavity features that result in multiple bodies, you cannot select to keep all of the resulting bodies or one or more selected bodies.
