## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function MakeOffset( _
   ByVal Distance As System.Double, _
   ByVal Direction As System.Boolean _
) As Body2
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IBody2
Dim Distance As System.Double
Dim Direction As System.Boolean
Dim value As Body2

value = instance.MakeOffset(Distance, Direction)
```

### C#

```csharp
Body2 MakeOffset(
   System.double Distance,
   System.bool Direction
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Body2^ MakeOffset(
   System.double Distance,
   System.bool Direction
)
```

NOTE:

See

### Parameters

- `Distance`: Distance by which to offset the selected surface body
- `Direction`: True to offset the selected surface body in the opposite direction, false to offset

the surface body along the normal

### Return Value

Pointer to the newly created
