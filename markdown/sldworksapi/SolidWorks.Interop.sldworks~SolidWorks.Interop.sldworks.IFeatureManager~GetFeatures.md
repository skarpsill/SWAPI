Dim ToplevelOnly As System.Boolean
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.GetFeatures(ToplevelOnly)
```

### C#

   System.bool ToplevelOnly
)
```

## Remarks

If TopLevelOnly is false, then this method gets all of the feature and child features in this document.kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}It does not get features in components.

The features that are returned by this method can be in any order. You should not rely on the order to indicate anything about children or parents. If hierarchy and order information is needed, then use[IPartDoc::FirstFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IPartDoc~FirstFeature.html)or[IPartDoc::IFirstFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IPartDoc~IFirstFeature.html)or[IModelDoc2::FirstFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~FirstFeature.html)or[IModelDoc2::FirstFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~IFirstFeature.html),[IFeature::GetNextFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetNextFeature.html)or[IFeatureIGetNextFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~IGetNextFeature.html),[IFeature::GetFirstSubFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetFirstSubFeature.html)or[IFeature::IGetFirstSubFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~IGetFirstSubFeature.html), and[IFeature::GetNextSubFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetNextSubFeature.html)or[IFeature::IGetNextSubFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~IGetNextSubFeature.html)to retrieve your information.
