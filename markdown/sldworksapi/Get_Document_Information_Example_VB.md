# Get Document Information Example (VBA)

This example shows how to get the title and
document type of the active document.

'---------------------------------------------

Sub ModelInfo( )

' Define variable used to hold the SldWorks
object

Dim swApp As
Object

' Define variable used to hold the ModelDoc
object

Dim Model As
Object

Dim TopName
As String

' Constant enumerators

Const swDocPART
= 1

Const swDocASSEMBLY
= 2

Const swDocDRAWING
= 3

' Create or attach to SOLIDWORKS session.
Because you are grabbing the active document, this example requires that
SOLIDWORKS be running and have a document already loaded.

Set swApp =
CreateObject("SldWorks.Application")

' Grab the currently active
document

Set Model =
swApp.ActiveDoc

' Check to see if a document is loaded

If Model Is
Nothing Then

' If no model is currently
loaded, then exit

Exit Sub

End if

' Determine the document
type. If the document is a drawing, then send a message to the user.

If (Model.GetType<> swDocDRAWING) Then

swApp.SendMsgToUser("This is not a drawing")

Else

' Get the document title

Let TopName
= Model.GetTitle

End If

End Sub
