## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetWallThickness( _
   ByVal Forward As System.Boolean _
) As System.Double
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IExtrudeFeatureData2
Dim Forward As System.Boolean
Dim value As System.Double

value = instance.GetWallThickness(Forward)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.double GetWallThickness(
   System.bool Forward
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.double GetWallThickness(
   System.bool Forward
)
```

NOTE:

See
