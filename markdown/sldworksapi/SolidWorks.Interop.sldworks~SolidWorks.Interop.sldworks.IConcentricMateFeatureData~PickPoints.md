## Remarks

After you set the pick points for a given selection of

[IConcentricMateFeatureData::EntitiesToMate](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IConcentricMateFeatureData~EntitiesToMate.html)

, you cannot modify the pick points. If you want to use new pick points, then you must create an entirely new concentric mate.
