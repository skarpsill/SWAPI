# Angle Property (IRefPlaneFeatureData)

Gets or sets the angle of the reference plane feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property Angle As System.Double
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IRefPlaneFeatureData
Dim value As System.Double

instance.Angle = value

value = instance.Angle
```

### C#

```csharp
System.double Angle {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.double Angle {
   System.double get();
   void set (    System.double value);
}
```

NOTE:
