# Is There a Projection Arrow and Is It Visible Example (VBA)

This example shows how to find out if:

- the selected drawing view is a projected view
- a projection arrow exists in the projected view
- the projected arrow is visible

```
'--------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open public_documents\samples\tutorial\advdrawings\foodprocessor.slddrw.
' 2. Double-click the projected view (i.e., the upper-right drawing view).
' 3. In the PropertyManager page, click the Arrow check box and
'    type a label for the projection arrow.
' 4. Click OK to close the PropertyManager page.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Creates a visible projection arrow for Drawing View2, which is
'    a projected view.
' 2. Examine the graphics area and Immediate window.
'
' NOTE: Because this drawing document is used elsewhere, do not save
' changes.
