# CreateSaveBodyFeature Method (IFeatureManager)

Creates a Save Bodies feature and creates part and assembly documents of the save bodies.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function CreateSaveBodyFeature( _
   ByVal Bodies As System.Object, _
   ByVal FilePaths As System.Object, _
   ByVal AssemName As System.String, _
   ByVal ConsumeBody As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal CopyCustomProperty As System.Boolean _
) As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeatureManager
Dim Bodies As System.Object
Dim FilePaths As System.Object
Dim AssemName As System.String
Dim ConsumeBody As System.Boolean
Dim CopyCustomProperty As System.Boolean
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.CreateSaveBodyFeature(Bodies, FilePaths, AssemName, ConsumeBody, CopyCustomProperty)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object CreateSaveBodyFeature(
   System.object Bodies,
   System.object FilePaths,
   System.string AssemName,
   System.bool ConsumeBody,
   System.bool CopyCustomProperty
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ CreateSaveBodyFeature(
   System.Object^ Bodies,
   System.Object^ FilePaths,
   System.String^ AssemName,
   System.bool ConsumeBody,
   System.bool CopyCustomProperty
)
```
