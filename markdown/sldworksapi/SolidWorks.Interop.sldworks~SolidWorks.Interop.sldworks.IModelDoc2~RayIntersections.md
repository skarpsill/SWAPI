# RayIntersections Method (IModelDoc2)

Obsolete. Superseded by

[IModelDocExtension::RayIntersections](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~RayIntersections.html)

.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function RayIntersections( _
   ByVal BodiesIn As System.Object, _
   ByVal BasePointsIn As System.Object, _
   ByVal VectorsIn As System.Object, _
   ByVal Options As System.Integer, _
   ByVal HitRadius As System.Double, _
   ByVal Offset As System.Double _
) As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IModelDoc2
Dim BodiesIn As System.Object
Dim BasePointsIn As System.Object
Dim VectorsIn As System.Object
Dim Options As System.Integer
Dim HitRadius As System.Double
Dim Offset As System.Double
Dim value As System.Integer

value = instance.RayIntersections(BodiesIn, BasePointsIn, VectorsIn, Options, HitRadius, Offset)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int RayIntersections(
   System.object BodiesIn,
   System.object BasePointsIn,
   System.object VectorsIn,
   System.int Options,
   System.double HitRadius,
   System.double Offset
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.int RayIntersections(
   System.Object^ BodiesIn,
   System.Object^ BasePointsIn,
   System.Object^ VectorsIn,
   System.int Options,
   System.double HitRadius,
   System.double Offset
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `BodiesIn`: Array of[bodies](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IBody2.html)that arekadov_tag{{</spaces>}}hit by the rays (see**Remarks**)
- `BasePointsIn`: Array of doubles containing the x,y,z base points of each ray
- `VectorsIn`: Array of doubles containing the direction vectors of each ray
- `Options`: Number of options as defined in[swRayPtsOpts_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swRayPtsOpts_e.html)
- `HitRadius`: Radius of hit cylinder; this is used mainly in grazing cases to establish a hit
- `Offset`: Length tolerance to use to establish whether a hit on a face represents the entry or exit of the ray from the body (seeRemarks)

### Return Value

Number of intersections found

## VBA Syntax

See

[ModelDoc2::RayIntersections](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~ModelDoc2~RayIntersections.html)

.

## Remarks

The method performs the intersection operations between the specified bodies and the ray vectors. To get the results (a set of intersection points, intersection normals, and the bodies that were hit from your bodiesInarray) of the intersection operations, you must call[IModelDoc2::GetRayIntersectionsPoints](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~GetRayIntersectionsPoints.html)or[IModelDoc2::IGetRayIntersectionPoints](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~IGetRayIntersectionsPoints.html)and[IModelDoc2::GetRayIntersectionTopology](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~GetRayIntersectionsTopology.html)or[IModelDoc2::IGetRayIntersectionsTopology](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~IGetRayIntersectionsTopology.html).

Information returned by IModelDoc2::GetRayIntersectionsPoints, IModelDoc2::IGetRayIntersectionPoints, IModelDoc2::GetRayIntersectionTopology, and IModelDoc2::IGetRayIntersectionsTopology depends partially on the value of the options argument. Valid values can be concatenated together using bitwise operations. See IModelDoc2::GetRayIntersectionsPoints or IModelDoc2::IGetRayIntersectionPoints to see which data is always output regardless of the values specified in the options argument.

For each ray that hits an edge or a vertex, the offset distance is added in both the positive and negative directions along the ray and the points computed are tested for spatial inclusion in the hit body. This determines if the ray was entering, leaving, or just grazing the body at the hit point. Entry and exit onto faces can be computed does not require such an offset.
