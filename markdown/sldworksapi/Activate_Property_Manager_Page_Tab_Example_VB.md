# Activate Property Manager Page Tab Example (VBA)

## Activate PropertyManager Page Tab Example (VBA)

The following code example demonstrates how SOLIDWORKS
add-ins can use IPropertyManagerPageTab.Activate to programmatically select
a tab on a SOLIDWORKS PropertyManager page.

```
'----------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Copy and paste Main into your macro.
' 2. Click Insert > Class Module and copy and paste Class1 into the module.
' 3. Add a reference to SOLIDWORKS <version> exposed type libraries
'    for add-in use.
' 4. Open an assembly that has multiple components.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Creates a PropertyManager page called Materials and Dimensions
'    with two tabs:
'    * Materials
'    * Dimensions
' 2. Selects the Materials tab.
' 3. Examine the PropertyManager page.
