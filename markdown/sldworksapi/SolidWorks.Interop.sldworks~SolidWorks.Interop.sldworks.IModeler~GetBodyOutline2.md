# GetBodyOutline2 Method (IModeler)

Gets the curves that form the outline of a body.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetBodyOutline2( _
   ByVal BodyList As System.Object, _
   ByVal Direction As MathVector, _
   ByVal Tolerance As System.Double, _
   ByVal ProjectOnPlane As System.Boolean, _
   ByRef Curves As System.Object, _
   ByRef TopolEntities As System.Object, _
   ByRef Outline As System.Object _
) As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IModeler
Dim BodyList As System.Object
Dim Direction As MathVector
Dim Tolerance As System.Double
Dim ProjectOnPlane As System.Boolean
Dim Curves As System.Object
Dim TopolEntities As System.Object
Dim Outline As System.Object
Dim value As System.Integer

value = instance.GetBodyOutline2(BodyList, Direction, Tolerance, ProjectOnPlane, Curves, TopolEntities, Outline)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int GetBodyOutline2(
   System.object BodyList,
   MathVector Direction,
   System.double Tolerance,
   System.bool ProjectOnPlane,
   out System.object Curves,
   out System.object TopolEntities,
   out System.object Outline
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.int GetBodyOutline2(
   System.Object^ BodyList,
   MathVector^ Direction,
   System.double Tolerance,
   System.bool ProjectOnPlane,
   [Out] System.Object^ Curves,
   [Out] System.Object^ TopolEntities,
   [Out] System.Object^ Outline
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `BodyList`: Array of bodies
- `Direction`: [IMathVector](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IMathVector.html)direction of viewParamDesc
- `Tolerance`: Tolerance (Parasolid default 0.00001)ParamDesc
- `ProjectOnPlane`: True to project the curves onto a plane, false to not (see

Remarks

)
- `Curves`: Array of 3D trimmed curves that form the outline
- `TopolEntities`: Array of topological entities associated with the outline
- `Outline`: Array of integers indicating which curves belong to which outline

ParamDesc

### Return Value

Number of curves that form the outline

## VBA Syntax

See

[Modeler::GetBodyOutline2](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Modeler~GetBodyOutline2.html)

.

## Examples

[Get Body Outline (VBA)](Get_Body_Outline_Example_VB.htm)

[Get Body Outline (VB.NET)](Get_Body_Outline_Example_VBNET.htm)

[Get Body Outline (C#)](Get_Body_Outline_Example_CSharp.htm)

## Remarks

When rendered, the array of curves returned in Curves might not display as a continuous outline of the body.

To close gaps:

1. Call this method with ProjectOnPlane = true.
2. Post-process the array of curves returned in Curves to interpolate the end points of each curve to generate a continuous outline of the body. See the

  Get Body Outline

  examples.
