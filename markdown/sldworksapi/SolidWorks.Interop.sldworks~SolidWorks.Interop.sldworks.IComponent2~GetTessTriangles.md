# GetTessTriangles Method (IComponent2)

Gets the triangles that make up the shaded picture tessellation for this component.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetTessTriangles( _
   ByVal NoConversion As System.Boolean _
) As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IComponent2
Dim NoConversion As System.Boolean
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.GetTessTriangles(NoConversion)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object GetTessTriangles(
   System.bool NoConversion
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ GetTessTriangles(
   System.bool NoConversion
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `NoConversion`: True prohibits conversion to user units from system units, false does not

### Return Value

Array (see**Remarks**)

## VBA Syntax

See

[Component2::GetTessTriangles](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Component2~GetTessTriangles.html)

.

## Remarks

Tessellation information is available only when the component is loaded as lightweight.

These triangles are intended for graphics display purposes and do not represent a tessellation that could be used, for example, by a machining application. If you need the type of accuracy associated with a machining product, we recommend that you traverse the body faces and extract the topology and geometry data to create your own faceting.

The format of the returned data is:

- float x, y, z - first point in meters
- float x, y, z - second point in meters
- float x, y, z - third point in meters

for the set of triangles for the component.

The total size of the data is[9 x sizeof(float) x (number of triangles)].
