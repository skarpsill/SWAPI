# IGetWeldBeads Method (IView)

Gets all of the weld beads on this drawing view.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetWeldBeads( _
   ByVal NumWeldBead As System.Integer _
) As WeldBead
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IView
Dim NumWeldBead As System.Integer
Dim value As WeldBead

value = instance.IGetWeldBeads(NumWeldBead)
```

### C#

```csharp
WeldBead IGetWeldBeads(
   System.int NumWeldBead
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
WeldBead^ IGetWeldBeads(
   System.int NumWeldBead
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `NumWeldBead`: Total number of weld beads on this drawing view

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of

  [weld beads](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IWeldBead.html)
- VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

## Remarks

Use this method to obtain the array of weld beads all at once instead of calling[IView::GetFirstWeldBead](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IView~GetFirstWeldBead.html)and then repeatedly calling[IWeldBead::GetNext](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IWeldBead~GetNext.html)to obtain the weld beads in the drawing view.

Before calling this method, call[IView::GetWeldBeadCount](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IView~GetWeldBeadCount.html)to get the value for numWeldBead.
