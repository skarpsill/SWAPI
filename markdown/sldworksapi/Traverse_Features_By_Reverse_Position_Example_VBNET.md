# Traverse Features By Reverse Position Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to traverse backwards through the list of features in
the FeatureManager design tree. Features are obtained by their position using
IModelDoc2::FeatureByPositionReverse.

```
'------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. A part document is open in SOLIDWORKS.
' 2. Open the Immediate window.
' 3. Run the macro.
'
' Postconditions: Examine the Immediate window for
' the position and names of the features in the
' FeatureManager design tree in reverse
' chronological order.
