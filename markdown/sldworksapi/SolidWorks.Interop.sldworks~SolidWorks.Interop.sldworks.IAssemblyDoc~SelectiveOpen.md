# SelectiveOpen Method (IAssemblyDoc)

Selectively opens the components of an assembly that is opened in Large Design Review mode.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function SelectiveOpen( _
   ByVal SelectedComponents As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal OpenLightWeight As System.Boolean _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IAssemblyDoc
Dim SelectedComponents As System.Boolean
Dim OpenLightWeight As System.Boolean
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.SelectiveOpen(SelectedComponents, OpenLightWeight)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool SelectiveOpen(
   System.bool SelectedComponents,
   System.bool OpenLightWeight
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool SelectiveOpen(
   System.bool SelectedComponents,
   System.bool OpenLightWeight
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `SelectedComponents`: True to open only the components in the current selection list, false to open all of the components in the assembly
- `OpenLightWeight`: True to open the components in lightweight mode, false to not

### Return Value

True if successful, false if not (see

Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

## Remarks

This method only works for assemblies that are opened in Large Design Review mode.

To open an assembly in Large Design Review mode:

1. Call

  [ISldWorks::GetOpenDocSpec](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~GetOpenDocSpec.html)

  to create an instance of

  [IDocumentSpecification](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IDocumentSpecification.html)

  .
2. Set

  [IDocumentSpecification::ViewOnly](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IDocumentSpecification~ViewOnly.html)

  to true.
3. Call

  [ISldWorks::OpenDoc7](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~OpenDoc7.html)

  , passing it the instance of IDocumentSpecification.

Before calling this method, call[IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~SelectByID2.html)to select the components that you want to open.
