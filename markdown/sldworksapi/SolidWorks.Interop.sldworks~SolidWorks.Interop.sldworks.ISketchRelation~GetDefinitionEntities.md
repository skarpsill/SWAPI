System.Object^ GetDefinitionEntities();
```

NOTE:

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

Array of the actual entities for this sketch relation

## VBA Syntax

See

[SketchRelation::GetDefinitionEntities](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~SketchRelation~GetDefinitionEntities.html)

.

## Remarks

When you created a sketch relation, an internal entity may have also been created to define that sketch relation. For example, if you added a sketch relation by specifying or selecting a point and an edge, a sketch segment may have been created. If this happened, then[ISketchRelation::GetEntities](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchRelation~GetEntities.html)and[ISketchRelation::IGetEntities](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchRelation~IGetEntities.html)would return the point and sketch segment. To get the actual entities used to define the sketch relation, call ISketchRelation::GetDefinitionEntities or[ISketchRelation::IGetDefinitionEntities](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchRelation~IGetDefinitionEntities.html).

Because some of the objects may be NULL, you should check for this before accessing them. You should deallocate any dynamically allocated memory.
