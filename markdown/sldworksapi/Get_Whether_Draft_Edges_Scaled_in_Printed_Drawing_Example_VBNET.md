# Get Whether Draft Edges Scaled in Printed Drawing Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to get whether draft edges are scaled when printing a
drawing in high quality.

```
'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Verify that the specified drawing exists.
' 2. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Opens the drawing.
' 2. Examine the Immediate window.
