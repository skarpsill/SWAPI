   ByVal Count As System.Integer _
) As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IRefPlaneFeatureData
Dim Count As System.Integer
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.IGetSelections(Count)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object IGetSelections(
   System.int Count
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ IGetSelections(

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of entities of size Count

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

## Remarks

Call[IRefPlaneFeatureData::GetSelectionsCount](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IRefPlaneFeatureData~GetSelectionsCount.html)to get the value for Count.

See[Accessing Selections that Define Features](sldworksAPIProgGuide.chm::/Miscellaneous/Accessing_Selections_that_Define_Features.htm)for additional details on using this method.

**IMPORTANT:**Reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2010 or later are constraint based; reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2009 or earlier are not. See the**Remarks**section in the[IRefPlaneFeatureData interface](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IRefPlaneFeatureData.html)topic for details about reference planes and this interface.
