# Pitch Property (IHelixFeatureData)

Gets or sets the pitch of this helix feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property Pitch As System.Double
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IHelixFeatureData
Dim value As System.Double

instance.Pitch = value

value = instance.Pitch
```

### C#

```csharp
System.double Pitch {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.double Pitch {
   System.double get();
   void set (    System.double value);
}
```

NOTE:

## Remarks

| For... | This property sets... |
| --- | --- |
| Helixes | Distance between turns |
| Spirals | Radial distance between revolutions of the curve |

**NOTES**:

- If the

  [helix is defined](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IHelixFeatureData~DefinedBy.html)

  as swHelixDefinedBy_e.swHelixDefinedByHeightAndRevolution, then you cannot change the pitch of the helix.
- If setting a value for pitch for the first region only, then you cannot change diameter, height, or revolution.
