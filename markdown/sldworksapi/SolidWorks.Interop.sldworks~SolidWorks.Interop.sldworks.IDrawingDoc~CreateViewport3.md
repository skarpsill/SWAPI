# CreateViewport3 Method (IDrawingDoc)

Creates a an empty view in a drawing.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function CreateViewport3( _
   ByVal LowerLeftX As System.Double, _
   ByVal LowerLeftY As System.Double, _
   ByVal SketchSize As System.Short, _
   ByVal Scale As System.Double _
) As View
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IDrawingDoc
Dim LowerLeftX As System.Double
Dim LowerLeftY As System.Double
Dim SketchSize As System.Short
Dim Scale As System.Double
Dim value As View

value = instance.CreateViewport3(LowerLeftX, LowerLeftY, SketchSize, Scale)
```

### C#

```csharp
View CreateViewport3(
   System.double LowerLeftX,
   System.double LowerLeftY,
   System.short SketchSize,
   System.double Scale
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
View^ CreateViewport3(
   System.double LowerLeftX,
   System.double LowerLeftY,
   System.short SketchSize,
   System.double Scale
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `LowerLeftX`: x value for lower-left coordinate for the view
- `LowerLeftY`: y value for lower-left coordinate for the viewParamDesc
- `SketchSize`: Approximate number of entriesParamDesc
- `Scale`: Scale to use for the viewParamDesc

### Return Value

Pointer to the newly created[IView](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IView.html)objectParamDesc

## VBA Syntax

See

[DrawingDoc::CreateViewport3](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~DrawingDoc~CreateViewport3.html)

.

## Remarks

You cannot set the size of an empty view or resize it. Instead, resizing of the view occurs automatically when you add sketch or model geometry to the view.

The center of the empty view is computed from the specified lower-left corner and default values for the upper-right corner. The latter is set to (0.001, 0.001). The center is computed as follows:

center = lower-left_corner + (upper-right_corner - lower-left_corner) / 2.0

To move the view, use[IView::Position](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IView~Position.html)or[IView::IPosition](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IView~IPosition.html).

The default SketchSize value is 0. If you are creating more than 500 sketch entities, specify a value instead of using the default.

After you use this method, you can create sketch entities in the new view. One advantage is that users can move the entities around the drawing by dragging the view instead of selecting all the entities.
