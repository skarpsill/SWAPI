# EntitiesToMate Property (IPerpendicularMateFeatureData)

Gets or sets the entities to mate in this perpendicular mate.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property EntitiesToMate As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IPerpendicularMateFeatureData
Dim value As System.Object

instance.EntitiesToMate = value

value = instance.EntitiesToMate
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object EntitiesToMate {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.Object^ EntitiesToMate {
   System.Object^ get();
   void set (    System.Object^ value);
}
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Property Value

Entities to mate (see

Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

See

[PerpendicularMateFeatureData::EntitiesToMate](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~PerpendicularMateFeatureData~EntitiesToMate.html)

.

## Examples

See the

[IPerpendicularMateFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IPerpendicularMateFeatureData.html)

example.

## Remarks

You can create perpendicular mates with the following mate entity combinations:

| Mate entity/Mate entity | IRefAxis (cone, cylinder) | IFace2 (extrusion face, draft is not allowed) | IEdge , IRefAxis, ICenterLine , ISketchLine (line) | IRefPlane | ISurface , IFace2 (non-analytic surface) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IRefAxis (cone, cylinder) | ● | ● | ● |  | ● |
| IFace2 (extrusion face, draft is not allowed) | ● | ● | ● |  |  |
| IEdge, IRefAxis, ICenterLine, ISketchLine (line) | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● |
| IRefPlane |  |  | ● | ● |  |
| ISurface, IFace2 (non-analytic surface) | ● |  | ● |  | ● |

Instead of specifying this property, you can use[IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~SelectByID2.html)to pre-select the entities to mate using Mark = 1. You can pre-select mate entities during mate creation, but not during mate editing.
