```

```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

## VBA Syntax

See

[DatumOrigin::Reattach](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~DatumOrigin~Reattach.html)

.

## Remarks

This method:

- Lets you manipulate the datum origin. It attaches the datum origin to the currently selected entity.
- Expects that only one entity (vertex, edge, or sketch point) is selected. That selected entity must be in the same view as the original entity to which the datum origin was attached.
