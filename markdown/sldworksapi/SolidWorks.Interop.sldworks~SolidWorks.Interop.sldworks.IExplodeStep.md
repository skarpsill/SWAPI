# IExplodeStep Interface

Allows access to an explode step in the explode view of the active assembly configuration.

**NOTE:**Click the**Members**link, located near the top of the topic, to see this interface's methods and properties.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Public Interface IExplodeStep
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IExplodeStep
```

### C#

```csharp
public interface IExplodeStep
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
public interface class IExplodeStep
```

## VBA Syntax

See

[ExplodeStep](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~ExplodeStep.html)

.

## Examples

[Add Regular Explode Step (VBA)](Add_Explode_Step_Example_VB.htm)

[Edit Radial Explode Step (VBA)](Edit_Radial_Explode_Step_Example_VB.htm)

## Remarks

This interface is valid only for assemblies. To access the explode steps of an explode view of multibody parts, see[IPartExplodeStep](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IPartExplodeStep.html).

If this is a subassembly explode step, then you can call only one method on this interface,[IExplodeStep::GetSubAssemblyExplodeSteps](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IExplodeStep~GetSubAssemblyExplodeSteps.html), to retrieve the nested explode steps of this subassembly explode step.

The setter properties and methods of this interface:

- Always clear selection lists.
- Do not work if the Explode PropertyManager is open.
- Do not work if any component is being edited in the context of the assembly.

To edit an explode step that is not a subassembly explode step:

1. Use

  [IConfigurationManager::ActiveConfiguration](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IConfigurationManager~ActiveConfiguration.html)

  to get the active configuration of the assembly.
2. Access the explode step. See the

  Accessors

  section.
3. Call

  [IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~SelectByID2.html)

  to select:

  1. Components to move with Mark = 1.
  2. An explode direction entity (cylindrical

    [face](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFace2.html)

    , conical face, linear

    [edge](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IEdge.html)

    , or

    [axis](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IRefAxis.html)

    ) with Mark = 2 (regular explode steps) or Mark = 34 (radial explode steps).
  3. A rotation axis with Mark = 32, if RotateAboutOrigin is set to false (regular explode steps only).
  4. A diverge direction entity with Mark = 64 (radial explode steps only).
4. Call

  [ISelectionMgr::GetSelectedObject6](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISelectionMgr~GetSelectedObject6.html)

  to get the components selected in step 3a.
5. Call

  [IExplodeStep::SetComponents](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IExplodeStep~SetComponents.html)

  , passing in the components gotten in step 4.
6. Call

  [IExplodeStep::SetExplodeDirection](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IExplodeStep~SetExplodeDirection.html)

  , passing in the explode direction entity that was selected in step 3b. See

  Notes

  .
7. Call

  [IExplodeStep::SetRotationAxis](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IExplodeStep~SetRotationAxis.html)

  , passing in the rotation axis that was selected in step 3c (for regular explode steps only).
8. Set

  [IExplodeStep::DivergeDirection](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IExplodeStep~DivergeDirection.html)

  to the diverge direction entity that was selected in step 3d (for radial explode steps only). See

  Notes

  .
9. Modify other explode step properties.

**Notes**:

When editing the object entity for the explode direction or rotation axis, please bear in mind:

| If... | Then... |
| --- | --- |
| Both object and manipulator index are valid | Both object and manipulator index are set. |
| Manipulator index is valid, but object is invalid | Manipulator index is set, and object is unchanged. |
| Object is valid, but manipulator index is invalid | Object is set, but the manipulator index is reset to: Z direction index for explode direction. XY ring index for rotation axis. |
| Both object and manipulator index are invalid | No values change. |

When editing the diverge direction object entity or the diverge from axis flag, please bear in mind:

| If... | Then... |
| --- | --- |
| Diverge direction object is valid | IExplodeStep::DivergeDirection properly sets the diverge direction, and IExplodeStep::DivergeFromAxis is set to true. |
| Diverge direction object is null | IExplodeStep::DivergeDirection is set to null, and IExplodeStep::DivergeFromAxis is set to false. |
| Diverge direction object is invalid | Direction object entity is unchanged. |
| IExplodeStep::DivergeFromAxis is set to false | IExplodeStep::DivergeFromAxis is set to false, and the diverge direction object is set to null. |
| IExplodeStep::DivergeFromAxis is set to true | No values change. |
