# IFeatureReferenceCurve Method (IModelDoc)

Obsolete. Superseded by

[IModelDoc2::IFeatureReferenceCurve](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~IFeatureReferenceCurve.html)

.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IFeatureReferenceCurve( _
   ByVal NumOfCurves As System.Integer, _
   ByVal BaseCurves As System.IntPtr, _
   ByVal Merge As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal FromFileName As System.String, _
   ByRef ErrorCode As System.Integer _
) As ReferenceCurve
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IModelDoc
Dim NumOfCurves As System.Integer
Dim BaseCurves As System.IntPtr
Dim Merge As System.Boolean
Dim FromFileName As System.String
Dim ErrorCode As System.Integer
Dim value As ReferenceCurve

value = instance.IFeatureReferenceCurve(NumOfCurves, BaseCurves, Merge, FromFileName, ErrorCode)
```

### C#

```csharp
ReferenceCurve IFeatureReferenceCurve(
   System.int NumOfCurves,
   System.IntPtr BaseCurves,
   System.bool Merge,
   System.string FromFileName,
   out System.int ErrorCode
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
ReferenceCurve^ IFeatureReferenceCurve(
   System.int NumOfCurves,
   System.IntPtr BaseCurves,
   System.bool Merge,
   System.String^ FromFileName,
   [Out] System.int ErrorCode
)
```
