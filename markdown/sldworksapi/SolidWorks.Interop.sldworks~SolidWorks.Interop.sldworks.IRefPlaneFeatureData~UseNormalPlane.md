# UseNormalPlane Property (IRefPlaneFeatureData)

Gets or sets whether to:

- Use the plane normal to the selected plane
- Automatically size the plane to either the geometry on which it is created or to the bounding box of the model geometry

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property UseNormalPlane As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IRefPlaneFeatureData
Dim value As System.Boolean

instance.UseNormalPlane = value

value = instance.UseNormalPlane
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool UseNormalPlane {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.bool UseNormalPlane {
   System.bool get();
   void set (    System.bool value);
}
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Property Value

True to use a plane normal to the selected plane and automatically size the plane, false to not

## VBA Syntax

See

[RefPlaneFeatureData::UseNormalPlane](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~RefPlaneFeatureData~UseNormalPlane.html)

.

## Remarks

If this property is true, then you can get or set[IRefPlaneFeatureData::Angle](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IRefPlaneFeatureData~Angle.html).

**IMPORTANT:**Reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2010 or later are constraint based; reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2009 or earlier are not. See the**Remarks**section in the[IRefPlaneFeatureData interface](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IRefPlaneFeatureData.html)topic for details about reference planes and this interface.
