## Remarks

| If... | To select a feature, use... | To select a component, use... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Using IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2 to select features and components, ordered selection of the features and components is required | 1 to mark Direction 1, and 2 to mark Direction 2 4 to mark the features to pattern 2097152 to mark references for Offset1 and Offset2 8388608 to mark a seed instance reference when FromCentroid1 or FromCentroid2 is false | 1 to mark the components to pattern 2 and 4 to mark the directions |
| Directly selecting a feature or component using IFeature::Select2 | 1 to mark Direction 1, and 2 to mark Direction 2 4 to mark the features to pattern 2097152 to mark references for Offset1 and Offset2 8388608 to mark a seed instance reference when FromCentroid1 or FromCentroid2 is false | ISelectData::Mark and IComponent2::Select4 1 to mark the components to pattern 2 and 4 to mark the directions |

If VaryInstance = true, then to indicate how to vary the individual pattern instances, decide on the type of pattern and call its corresponding method before calling this method:

| Type | Method |
| --- | --- |
| Increment | IFeatureManager::InsertVaryInstanceIncrement |
| Override | IFeatureManager::InsertVaryInstanceOverride |
