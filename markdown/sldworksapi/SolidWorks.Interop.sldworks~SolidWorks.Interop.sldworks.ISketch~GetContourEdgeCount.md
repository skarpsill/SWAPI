# GetContourEdgeCount Method (ISketch)

Gets the number of edges for this sketch contour.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetContourEdgeCount() As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISketch
Dim value As System.Integer

value = instance.GetContourEdgeCount()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int GetContourEdgeCount()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.int GetContourEdgeCount();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

Number of edges

## VBA Syntax

See

[Sketch::GetContourEdgeCount](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Sketch~GetContourEdgeCount.html)

.

## Remarks

If the sketch contour is not closed or contains interior non-construction elements, this method returns 0.

Call this method before calling[ISketch::IGetContourEdges](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketch~IGetContourEdges.html)to get the size of the array for that method.
