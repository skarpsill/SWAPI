# Get Top-level Components Using Component IDs Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to get the top-level components in an assembly using
their component IDs.

```
'--------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open an assembly document containing subassemblies.
' 2. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Traverses the assembly.
' 2. Gets the name and component ID of each top-level component
'    in the assembly.
' 3. Adds each component ID to an array and traverses the array.
'    a. Gets each top-level component using its component ID.
'    b. Gets the name and component ID of each top-level component
'       in the assembly.
' 4. Examine the Immediate window and FeatureManager design tree.
