# Select Multiple Objects for Selection Boxes Example (VBA)

This example shows how to select multiple
objects and add the selected objects to different selection boxes on a
PropertyManager page.

```vb
'--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
 ' kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}1. Copy Modules - main to your project.
 ' kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}2. Insert a class module and copy Class Modules - clsPropMgr to that module.
 ' 3. Rename the class module to clsPropMgr.
 ' kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}3. Add swpublished.tlb to your project (click   Tools > References >
 ' kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}   kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}SOLIDWORKS version exposed type libraries for add-in use).
 ' 4. Verify that the specified assembly exists.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1. Opens the assembly.
 ' 2. Creates a PropertyManager page.
 ' 3. Examine the PropertyManager page and verify that three selected faces
 '    appear in the top selection box and two selected faces appear in the
 '    bottom selection box.
 ' 4. Close the PropertyManager page.
