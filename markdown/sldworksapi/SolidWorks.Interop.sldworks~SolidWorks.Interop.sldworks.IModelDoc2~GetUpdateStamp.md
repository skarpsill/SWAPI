## Remarks

The update stamp is an integer form of a time stamp. The update stamp is incremented for model state changes (i.e., suppress or unsuppress, configuration changes, feature changes, etc.) and for geometric changes (i.e., anything that requires a rebuild). This time stamp is not incremented for operations such as color changes, feature or configuration name changes, etc.
