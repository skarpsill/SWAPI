# IGroundPlaneFeatureData Interface

Allows access to a ground plane feature.

**NOTE:**Click the**Members**link, located near the top of the topic, to see this interface's methods and properties.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Public Interface IGroundPlaneFeatureData
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IGroundPlaneFeatureData
```

### C#

```csharp
public interface IGroundPlaneFeatureData
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
public interface class IGroundPlaneFeatureData
```

## VBA Syntax

See

[GroundPlaneFeatureData](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~GroundPlaneFeatureData.html)

.

## Examples

'VBA

'==========================================================================

'1. Ensure that the specified model exists.

## Remarks

Use this interface to insert a ground plane at each level of a plant assembly. Ground planes are used as reference geometry when inserting published assets at each level.

Call[IAssemblyDoc::ActivateGroundPlane](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IAssemblyDoc~ActivateGroundPlane.html)to activate the ground plane on the level where you want to insert a published asset; the asset's ground face snaps to the assembly's activated ground plane. Components with magnetic mates snap only to components that are also on the active ground plane.

Only one ground plane can be active at a given time in each assembly configuration.

See**Large Assemblies > Facility Layout**in the SOLIDWORKS user-interface help.
