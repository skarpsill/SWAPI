Dim instance As IChainPatternFeatureData
Dim TopDoc As System.Object
Dim Component As System.Object
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.AccessSelections(TopDoc, Component)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool AccessSelections(
   System.object TopDoc,
   System.object Component
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool AccessSelections(
   System.Object^ TopDoc,
   System.Object^ Component
)
```

Remarks

)
- `Component`: Component in which to modify the feature (see

Remarks

This method puts the model into a rollback state to allow access to the selections that define this feature. You must use either of the following methods to restore the rollback state:

- [IFeature::ModifyDefinition](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html)

  if you modified the feature
- [IChainPatternFeatureData::ReleaseSelectionAccess](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IChainPatternFeatureData~ReleaseSelectionAccess.html)

  if you did not
