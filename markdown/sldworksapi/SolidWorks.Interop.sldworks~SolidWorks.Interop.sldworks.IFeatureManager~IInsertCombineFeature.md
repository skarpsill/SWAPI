Combines the specified bodies in the multibody part to create a combine feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IInsertCombineFeature( _
   ByVal OperationType As System.Integer, _
   ByVal MainBody As Body2, _
   ByVal ToolsCount As System.Integer, _
   ByRef ToolsArr As Body2 _
) As Feature
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeatureManager
Dim OperationType As System.Integer
Dim MainBody As Body2
Dim ToolsCount As System.Integer
Dim ToolsArr As Body2
Dim value As Feature

value = instance.IInsertCombineFeature(OperationType, MainBody, ToolsCount, ToolsArr)
```

### C#

```csharp
Feature IInsertCombineFeature(
   System.int OperationType,
   Body2 MainBody,
   System.int ToolsCount,
   ref Body2 ToolsArr
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Feature^ IInsertCombineFeature(
   System.int OperationType,
   Body2^ MainBody,
   System.int ToolsCount,
   Body2^% ToolsArr
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `OperationType`: Operation as defined in[swBodyOperationType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swBodyOperationType_e.html)
- `MainBody`: | If OperationType is ... | Then set MainBody to ... |
| --- | --- |
| swBodyOperationType_e.SWBODYADD | Nothing or null |
| swBodyOperationType_e.SWBODYCUT | Target body |
| swBodyOperationType_e.SWBODYINTERSECT | Nothing or null |

(See

Remarks

)
- `ToolsCount`: Number of bodies to combine
- `ToolsArr`: - in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of

  [bodies](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IBody2.html)

  to combine of size ToolsCount (see

  Remarks

## Remarks

You can either call this method, directly passing in the bodies with MainBody and ToolVar, or you can:

1. Select the bodies using

  [IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~SelectByID2.html)

  as follows:

  | To select... | Use Mark... |
  | --- | --- |
  | MainBody | 1 |
