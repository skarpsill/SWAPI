# IInsertMacroFeature3 Method (IFeatureManager)

Inserts a macro feature in this model.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IInsertMacroFeature3( _
   ByVal BaseName As System.String, _
   ByVal ProgId As System.String, _
   ByRef MacroMethods As System.String, _
   ByVal ParamCount As System.Integer, _
   ByRef ParamNames As System.String, _

   ByRef EditBodies As Body2, _
   ByVal IconCount As System.Integer, _
   ByRef IconFiles As System.String, _
   ByVal Options As System.Integer _
) As Feature
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeatureManager
Dim BaseName As System.String
Dim ProgId As System.String
Dim MacroMethods As System.String
Dim ParamCount As System.Integer
Dim ParamNames As System.String
Dim ParamTypes As System.Integer
Dim ParamValues As System.String
Dim DimCount As System.Integer
Dim DimTypes As System.Integer
Dim DimCountValues As System.Double
Dim BodyCount As System.Integer
Dim EditBodies As Body2
Dim IconCount As System.Integer
Dim IconFiles As System.String
Dim Options As System.Integer
Dim value As Feature

value = instance.IInsertMacroFeature3(BaseName, ProgId, MacroMethods, ParamCount, ParamNames, ParamTypes, ParamValues, DimCount, DimTypes, DimCountValues, BodyCount, EditBodies, IconCount, IconFiles, Options)
```

### C#

```csharp
Feature IInsertMacroFeature3(
   System.string BaseName,
   System.string ProgId,
   ref System.string MacroMethods,
   System.int ParamCount,
   ref System.string ParamNames,
   ref System.int ParamTypes,
   ref System.string ParamValues,
   System.int DimCount,
   ref System.int DimTypes,
   ref System.double DimCountValues,
   System.int BodyCount,
   ref Body2 EditBodies,
   System.int IconCount,
   ref System.string IconFiles,
   System.int Options
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Feature^ IInsertMacroFeature3(
   System.String^ BaseName,
   System.String^ ProgId,
   System.String^% MacroMethods,
   System.int ParamCount,
   System.String^% ParamNames,
   System.int% ParamTypes,
   System.String^% ParamValues,
   System.int DimCount,
   System.int% DimTypes,
   System.double% DimCountValues,
   System.int BodyCount,
   Body2^% EditBodies,
   System.int IconCount,
   System.String^% IconFiles,
   System.int Options
)
```

(see

Remarks

)

### Return Value

Pointer to the

[IFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature.html)

object

## VBA Syntax

See

[FeatureManager::IInsertMacroFeature3](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~FeatureManager~IInsertMacroFeature3.html)

.

## Remarks

**BaseName**

- The argument BaseName is serialized within the feature and cannot be changed.
- You can find out the name of the base feature by using

  [IMacroFeatureData::GetBaseName](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IMacroFeatureData~GetBaseName.html)

  .
- The BaseName argument is also used to generate the name of the feature when the feature is first created.

**ProgId**

(Table)=========================================================

| If creating a macro feature using... | Then ProgId is... |
| --- | --- |
| COM callback methods | The name of the component that implements the COM callback methods. The object that is represented by ProgID must support the ISwComFeature interface. InsertMacroFeature3 ("Sample", "Sample.MyFeature", _ Nothing, paramNames, paramTypes, _ paramValues, dimTypes, dimValues, _ editBodies, iconFiles, _ swMacroFeatureByDefault) In the COM server, the Sample.Feature class is derived or supports the ISwComFeature interface. These methods support the macro feature's rebuild , edit , and security functions. |

kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}

**DimTypes**

Only these dimension types are supported by this method:

- swAngularDimension
- swLinearDimension
- swRadialDimension

**IconFiles**

The array of the file names for the icons can contain either three or nine strings.

| Number of strings in array | Types of images in this order | Image format and sizes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Three | Regular Suppressed Highlighted | Windows bitmap ( *.bmp ) format 16 pixels wide X 18 pixels high |
| Nine NOTES: This size array is only valid for macro features created in parts, assemblies, and drawings in SOLIDWORKS 2017 and later. SOLIDWORKS displays the appropriate images based on the current DPI setting of the display device. | Regular small Suppressed small Highlighted small Regular medium Suppressed medium Highlighted medium Regular large Suppressed large Highlighted large | Windows bitmap ( *.bmp ) format Recommended sizes are: Small: 20 pixels wide X 20 pixels high Medium: 32 pixels wide X 32 pixels high Large: 40 pixels wide X 40 pixels high |

You can specify either the full path name or just the file name for the strings; for example,c:\bitmaps\icon1.bmporicon1.bmp.

**Options**

swMacroFeatureOptions_e.swMacroFeatureEmbedMacroFile is not supported by programming languages for the Microsoft .NET Framework; for example, not supported by C#, Visual Basic .NET, or Managed C++.

See[Overview of Macro Features](sldworksAPIProgGuide.chm::/Macro_Features/Overview_of_Macro_Features.htm)for more information.
