# ReleaseSelectionAccess Method (IRefPlaneFeatureData)

Releases access to the selections that created the reference plane feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub ReleaseSelectionAccess()
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IRefPlaneFeatureData

instance.ReleaseSelectionAccess()
```

### C#

```csharp
void ReleaseSelectionAccess()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void ReleaseSelectionAccess();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

## VBA Syntax

See

[RefPlaneFeatureData::ReleaseSelectionAccess](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~RefPlaneFeatureData~ReleaseSelectionAccess.html)

.

## Remarks

[IRefPlaneFeatureData::AccessSelections](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IRefPlaneFeatureData~AccessSelections.html)and[IRefPlaneFeatureData::IAccessSelections](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IRefPlaneFeatureData~IAccessSelections.html)put the model in a rollback state to allow access to the selections that define the feature.

Use this method to restore the rollback state if you did not modify the feature, or use[IFeature::ModifyDefinition](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html)or[IFeature::IModifyDefinition2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~IModifyDefinition2.html)if you did modify the feature.

**IMPORTANT:**Reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2010 or later are constraint based; reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2009 or earlier are not. See the**Remarks**section in the[IRefPlaneFeatureData interface](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IRefPlaneFeatureData.html)topic for details about reference planes and this interface.
