[Get Corresponding Entities Between Parts and Drawing Views (C#)](Get_Corresponding_Entities_Between_Parts_and_Views_Example_CSharp.htm)

## Remarks

InputObject can be any object assigned a persistent reference or object ID; for example,[IAnnotation](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IAnnotation.html),[IFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature.html),[ISketch](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketch.html),[ISketchSegment](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISketchSegment.html), etc.

Annotation objects will be found only if they were previously imported into this drawing view.

Use[IModelDocExtension::GetCorresponding2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~GetCorresponding2.html)to get the part or assembly object that corresponds to an object in a drawing view.
