# Get Transform for Each Circular Pattern Instance Example (VBA)

This example shows how to get the transform for each instance in a circular
pattern feature.

```
'-----------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Verify that the specified part exists.
' 2. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Opens the part.
' 2. Selects the circular-pattern feature.
' 3. Get the number of instances in the circular-pattern
'    feature.
' 4. Gets the transform for each instance
'    in the circular-pattern feature.
' 5. Examine the Immediate window.
'
' NOTE: Because the part is used elsewhere, do not
' save changes.
