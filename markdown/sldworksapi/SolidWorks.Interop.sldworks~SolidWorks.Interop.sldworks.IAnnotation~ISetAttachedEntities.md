Dim LpArr As System.Object
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.ISetAttachedEntities(Count, LpArr)
```

### C#

   System.int Count,
   ref System.object LpArr
)

   System.Object^% LpArr
)
```

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Count`: Number of entities to which to attach this annotation
- `LpArr`: - in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of entities to attach this annotation to (see

  Remarks

  )

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

## Remarks

Not all annotations can be attached to a different entity (i.e., face, edge, or vertex). Experiment with this method to determine which annotations can be attached to which entities.
