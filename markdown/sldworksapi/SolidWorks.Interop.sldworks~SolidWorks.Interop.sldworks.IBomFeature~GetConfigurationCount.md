[BomFeature::GetConfigurationCount](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~BomFeature~GetConfigurationCount.html)

.

## Remarks

The view associated with this BOM can contain a model with multiple configurations.

For a top-level only style BOM table, there can be several Quantity columns, each showing the results for a different configuration.kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}For the other styles of BOM tables, only a particular configuration can be shown in the table, and that configuration can be changed. To determine the style of the BOM table, use[IBomFeature::TableType](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IBomFeature~TableType.html).

(Table)=========================================================

| If OnlyVisible is... | Then the value returned is... |
| --- | --- |
| True | Number of configurations currently shown in the BOM table. For a top-level only style BOM table, this could be any number from 0 to the total number of configurations available. For the other styles of BOM tables, this value is always 1. |
| false | Total number of configurations available. |

To get the configuration names, call IBomFeature::GetConfigurations or IBomFeature::IGetConfigurations .

Call this method before calling IBomFeature::IGetConfigurations to get the number of configurations.
