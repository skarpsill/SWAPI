.

## Remarks

FileName should include the path, filename, and filename extension to which to save the table as a text file.

Separator is typically a single character, but it can be a string. If Separator is empty, then the tab character is used.

**NOTE**: Although you can save a table as a text file for use with other applications, like Microsoft Excel, you cannot currently import a text file to a table in SOLIDWORKS.
