# ResolveAllLightWeightComponents Method (IAssemblyDoc)

Resolves the lightweight components in this assembly.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function ResolveAllLightWeightComponents( _
   ByVal WarnUser As System.Boolean _
) As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IAssemblyDoc
Dim WarnUser As System.Boolean
Dim value As System.Integer

value = instance.ResolveAllLightWeightComponents(WarnUser)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int ResolveAllLightWeightComponents(
   System.bool WarnUser
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.int ResolveAllLightWeightComponents(
   System.bool WarnUser
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `WarnUser`: True prompts the user to resolve components, false does not

### Return Value

Status of resolving the components as defined in[swComponentResolveStatus_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swComponentResolveStatus_e.html)

## VBA Syntax

See

[AssemblyDoc::ResolveAllLightWeightComponents](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~AssemblyDoc~ResolveAllLightWeightComponents.html)

.

## Examples

[Get Display Dimensions, GTols, and Surface-finish Symbols (VBA)](Get_Display_Dimensions,_Gtols,_and_Surface-Finish_Symbols_Example_VB.htm)

[Get Visibility of and Resolve Lightweight Components (VBA)](Get_Visibility_of_and_Resolve_Lightweight_Components_Example_VB.htm)

## Remarks

The assembly must be open in its own window. Call

[ISldWorks::ActivateDoc2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~ActivateDoc2.html)

or

[IModelDoc2::Visible](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~Visible.html)

to ensure that it is. If the assembly is only open as a reference in another document, then this method returns swComponentResolveStatus_e.swResolveNotPerformed.
