# Divide Surface into 3D Sketches Example (VBA)

This example:

- Shows how to divide the selected face into 3D
  sketches.
- Uses IModelDoc2::SketchConvertIsoCurves to extract
  ISO-parametric (UV) curves from a face and creates a set of evenly spaced
  sections in the U and V directions.

```
'-------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open a part.
' 2. Select a face.
' 3. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Generates 3D sketches.
' 2. Evenly divides the 3D sketches on the selected
'    face in the UV directions.
' 3. Examine the graphics area, FeatureManager design
'    tree, and the Immediate window.
