'--------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open public_documents\samples\tutorial\api\cstick.sldprt.
' 2. Copy and paste Main in the main module.
' 3. Click Insert > Class Module and copy and paste Class1 into that module.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Creates a cut-extrude feature on the top face of the
'    candlestick.
' 2. Undoes the cut-extrude feature and fires an undo post-notification.
