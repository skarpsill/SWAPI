## Remarks

To access this interface, you must declare it as SurfCutFeatureData or ISurfCutFeatureData.

Call this method before calling[ISurfaceCutFeatureData::IGetFeatureScopeBodies](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISurfaceCutFeatureData~IGetFeatureScopeBodies.html)to determine the size of the array for that method.

If[ISurfaceCutFeatureData::FeatureScope](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISurfaceCutFeatureData~FeatureScope.html)is false, then this method's return value is 0.
