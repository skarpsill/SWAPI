Sub main()
```

```
    Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks
    Dim swModel As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
    Dim swSelMgr As SldWorks.SelectionMgr
    Dim swDispDim As SldWorks.DisplayDimension
    Dim swDim As SldWorks.Dimension
    Dim i As Long
    Dim bRet As Boolean
```

```
    Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
    Set swModel = swApp.ActiveDoc
    Set swSelMgr = swModel.SelectionManager
    Set swDispDim = swSelMgr.GetSelectedObject6(1, 0)
    Set swDim = swDispDim.GetDimension
```

```
    Debug.Print "File = " & swModel.GetPathName
    Debug.Print "  Name of dimension = " & swDim.FullName
    Debug.Print "    Marked for drawing? " & swDispDim.MarkedForDrawing
