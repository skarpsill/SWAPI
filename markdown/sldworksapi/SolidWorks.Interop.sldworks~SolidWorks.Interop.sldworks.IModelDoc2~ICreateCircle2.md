# ICreateCircle2 Method (IModelDoc2)

Creates a circle based on a center point and a point on the circle.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function ICreateCircle2( _
   ByVal XC As System.Double, _
   ByVal YC As System.Double, _
   ByVal Zc As System.Double, _
   ByVal Xp As System.Double, _
   ByVal Yp As System.Double, _
   ByVal Zp As System.Double _
) As SketchSegment
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IModelDoc2
Dim XC As System.Double
Dim YC As System.Double
Dim Zc As System.Double
Dim Xp As System.Double
Dim Yp As System.Double
Dim Zp As System.Double
Dim value As SketchSegment

value = instance.ICreateCircle2(XC, YC, Zc, Xp, Yp, Zp)
```

### C#

```csharp
SketchSegment ICreateCircle2(
   System.double XC,
   System.double YC,
   System.double Zc,
   System.double Xp,
   System.double Yp,
   System.double Zp
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
SketchSegment^ ICreateCircle2(
   System.double XC,
   System.double YC,
   System.double Zc,
   System.double Xp,
   System.double Yp,
   System.double Zp
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `XC`: X value of the circle center point in meters
- `YC`: Y value of the circle center point in meters
- `Zc`: Z value of the circle center point in meters
- `Xp`: X value of the point on the circle in meters
- `Yp`: Y value of the point on the circle in meters
- `Zp`: Z value of the point on the circle in meters

### Return Value

Newly created

[circle](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchSegment.html)

(see

Remarks

)

## Remarks

This method creates a partial arc in the active 2D sketch. If a sketch is not active, then a new sketch iskadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}created. You can check for an active sketch using[IModelDoc2::GetActiveSketch2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~GetActiveSketch2.html)or[IModelDoc2::IGetActiveSketch2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~IGetActiveSketch2.html).

For COM applications, the object pointer returned from this method can be used to call any APIs on the[ISketchSegment](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchSegment.html)interface. The underlying[ISketchArc](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchArc.html)object can be obtained using QueryInterface on the returned ISketchSegment object.

OLE applications can define a new ISketchSegment or ISketchArc object using the returned Dispatch pointer. Visual Basic applications interpret the pointer for you automatically, so you can use the returned object to call ISketchSegment or ISketchArc functions.

[IModelDoc2::SetAddToDB](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~SetAddToDB.html)and[IModelDoc2::SetDisplayWhenAdded](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~SetDisplayWhenAdded.html)increase performance during entity creation by adding entities directly to the SOLIDWORKS database.

- IModelDoc2::SetAddToDB also avoids some of the peculiarities involved with creating entities via the user interface, such as inferencing, automatic relations, and snapping to the grid. Adding entities directly to the database also increases the performance of this API. When you are done creating entities, it is important to call IModelDoc2::SetAddToDB(false), to restore SOLIDWORKS to its normal operating mode.
- This method also works with IModelDoc2::SetDisplayWhenAdded. If you have called IModelDoc2::SetAddToDB(True), additional performance can be gained by calling IModelDoc2::SetDisplayWhenAdded(false) to disable immediate display of entities as they are added to the database. When you are done creating all of your sketch entities, you must redraw your document window (see

  [IModelDoc2::GraphicsRedraw2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~GraphicsRedraw2.html)

  ) to see the entities that you added. You should also restore the original display settings by calling IModelDoc2::SetDisplayWhenAdded(True).

To create a circle using a center point and radius, use[IModelDoc2::CreateCircleByRadius2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~CreateCircleByRadius2.html)or[IModelDoc2::ICreateCircleByRadius2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~ICreateCircleByRadius2.html). To create a partial arc, use[IModelDoc2::CreateArc2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~CreateArc2.html)or[IModelDoc2::ICreateArc2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~ICreateArc2.html).
