## Remarks

The value returned by this method does not include this cosmetic thread, which is the seed feature and not an instance of the pattern. Therefore, if this cosmetic thread is not used in any pattern feature, then this method returns 0.

Use this method before using[ICThread::IGetPatternedTransforms](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ICThread~IGetPatternedTransforms.html)to determine the size of the array to pass to that method.
