# IGetDefinitionEntities Method (ISketchRelation)

Obsolete. Superseded by

[ISketchRelation::IGetDefinitionEntities2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchRelation~IGetDefinitionEntities2.html)

.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetDefinitionEntities( _
   ByVal NumEntities As System.Integer _
) As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISketchRelation
Dim NumEntities As System.Integer
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.IGetDefinitionEntities(NumEntities)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object IGetDefinitionEntities(
   System.int NumEntities
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ IGetDefinitionEntities(
   System.int NumEntities
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `NumEntities`: Number of actual entities

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of the actual entities for this sketch relation

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

## Remarks

When you created a sketch relation, an internal entity may have also been created to define that sketch relation. For example, if you added a sketch relation by specifying or selecting a point and an edge, a sketch segment may have been created. If this happened, then[ISketchRelation::GetEntities](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchRelation~GetEntities.html)and[ISketchRelation::IGetEntities](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchRelation~IGetEntities.html)would return the point and sketch segment. To get the actual entities used to define the sketch relation, call[ISketchRelation::GetDefinitionEntities](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchRelation~GetDefinitionEntities.html)or ISketchRelation::IGetDefinitionEntities.

Because some of the objects may be NULL, you should check for this before accessing them. You should deallocate any dynamically allocated memory.

Before calling this method, call[ISketchRelation::GetEntitiesCount](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchRelation~GetEntitiesCount.html)to get the value for NumEntities.
