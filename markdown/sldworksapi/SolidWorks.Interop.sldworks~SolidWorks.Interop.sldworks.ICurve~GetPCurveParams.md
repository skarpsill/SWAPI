# GetPCurveParams Method (ICurve)

Obsolete. Superseded by

[ICurve::GetPCurveParams2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ICurve~GetPCurveParams2.html)

.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetPCurveParams() As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICurve
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.GetPCurveParams()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object GetPCurveParams()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ GetPCurveParams();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

Array of doubles describing the parameters of the curve (see**Remarks**)

## VBA Syntax

See

[Curve::GetPCurveParams](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Curve~GetPCurveParams.html)

.

## Examples

## Remarks

This method returns the curve as a series of segments, each of which has this form:

(w0*a0 + w1*a1*t + w2*a2*t**2 + w3*a3*t**3)

p(t) = --------------------------------------------

(w0 + w1*t + w2*t**2 + w3*t**3)

Where w is the weight coefficient and a is the polynomial coefficient.

The coefficients returned are vectors of dimensions "dim". For example, if the curve is rational, thendimension= 4, and the coefficients returned for each segment are as follows:

(a0x,a0y,a0z,w0),(a1x,a1y,a1z,w1)...

However, if the curve is returned as non-rational, thendimension= 3, and its coefficients are:

(a0x,a0y,a0z),(a1x,a1y,a1z),...

The size of the return value array is (3 +NumberKnots+NumberSegmentsxOrderxDimension).

The array is as follows:

[packedDouble1,packedDouble2,packedDouble3, knot1,knot2,...,CoefficientsSegment1[Dimension],CoefficientsSegment2[Dimension],...]

where:

packedDouble1: Integer pair containingReservedandOrder

packedDouble2: Integer pair containingNumberSegmentsandPeriodicity

packedDouble3: Integer pair containingNumberKnotsandDimension

knot1

knot2

...

CoefficientsSegment1[Dimension]

CoefficientsSegment2[Dimension]

...

The coefficients for each segment start with the constant term and end with the term of highest degree (for example, ConstantX, ConstantY, ConstantZ, AX, AY, AZ, BX, BY, BZ). The total number of coefficients is:

(NumberSegments) x (Order) x (Dimension).
