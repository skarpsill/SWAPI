# Get Bodies in Body Folders Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to get the bodies in body folder
features.

 '------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions: Open a part document that
 ' contains a body folder that contains
 ' one or more solid, surface, cut-list,
 ' or weldment items.
