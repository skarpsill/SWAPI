# AngleOrDistance Property (IRefPlaneFeatureData)

Gets or sets the angle or distance of the specified

[reference](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IRefPlaneFeatureData~Reference.html)

for this reference plane feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property AngleOrDistance( _
   ByVal Index As System.Integer _
) As System.Double
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IRefPlaneFeatureData
Dim Index As System.Integer
Dim value As System.Double

instance.AngleOrDistance(Index) = value

value = instance.AngleOrDistance(Index)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.double AngleOrDistance(
   System.int Index
) {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.double AngleOrDistance {
   System.double get(System.int Index);
   void set (System.int Index, System.double value);
}
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Index`: Index of the specified reference as defined in

[swRefPlaneReferenceIndex_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swRefPlaneReferenceIndex_e.html)

### Property Value

Angle or distance

## VBA Syntax

See

.

## Remarks

**IMPORTANT:**Reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2010 or later are constraint based; reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2009 or earlier are not. See the**Remarks**section in the[IRefPlaneFeatureData interface](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IRefPlaneFeatureData.html)topic for details about reference planes and this interface.
