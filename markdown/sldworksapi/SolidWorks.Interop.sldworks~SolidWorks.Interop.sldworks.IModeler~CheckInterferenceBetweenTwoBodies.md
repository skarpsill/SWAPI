# CheckInterferenceBetweenTwoBodies Method (IModeler)

Checks for interference between the specified bodies in an assembly.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function CheckInterferenceBetweenTwoBodies( _
   ByVal Body1 As System.Object, _
   ByVal Body2 As System.Object, _
   ByVal CoincidentInterference As System.Boolean, _
   ByRef Body1InterferedFaceArray As System.Object, _
   ByRef Body2InterferedFaceArray As System.Object, _
   ByRef IntersectedBodyArray As System.Object _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IModeler
Dim Body1 As System.Object
Dim Body2 As System.Object
Dim CoincidentInterference As System.Boolean
Dim Body1InterferedFaceArray As System.Object
Dim Body2InterferedFaceArray As System.Object
Dim IntersectedBodyArray As System.Object
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.CheckInterferenceBetweenTwoBodies(Body1, Body2, CoincidentInterference, Body1InterferedFaceArray, Body2InterferedFaceArray, IntersectedBodyArray)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool CheckInterferenceBetweenTwoBodies(
   System.object Body1,
   System.object Body2,
   System.bool CoincidentInterference,
   out System.object Body1InterferedFaceArray,
   out System.object Body2InterferedFaceArray,
   out System.object IntersectedBodyArray
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool CheckInterferenceBetweenTwoBodies(
   System.Object^ Body1,
   System.Object^ Body2,
   System.bool CoincidentInterference,
   [Out] System.Object^ Body1InterferedFaceArray,
   [Out] System.Object^ Body2InterferedFaceArray,
   [Out] System.Object^ IntersectedBodyArray
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Body1`: First body in interference detection (see

Remarks

)
- `Body2`: Second body in interference detection (see

Remarks

)
- `CoincidentInterference`: True to treat coincidence as interference, false to not
- `Body1InterferedFaceArray`: Array of faces in the first body that interfered with the second body
- `Body2InterferedFaceArray`: Array of faces in the second body that interfered with the first body
- `IntersectedBodyArray`: Array of interfering bodies

### Return Value

True if successful, false if not

## VBA Syntax

See

[Modeler::CheckInterferenceBetweenTwoBodies](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Modeler~CheckInterferenceBetweenTwoBodies.html)

.

## Examples

[Check for Interference Between Two Bodies (VBA)](Check_Interference_Between_Two_Bodies_Example_VB.htm)

## Remarks

Before calling this method, transform Body1 and Body2 to their proper positions in the coordinate space of the top-level assembly:

1. Select the assembly components.
2. Use

  [IComponent2::Transform2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IComponent2~Transform2.html)

  to get the transform of each component.
3. Call IComponent2::GetBodies2 for each component.
4. Use

  [IBody2::ApplyTransform](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IBody2~ApplyTransform.html)

  on each body using the transforms in step 2.
5. Specify Body1 and Body1 with the bodies that have been transformed to their correct positions in the assembly.
