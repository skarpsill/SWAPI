# Set New End Condition for Simple Hole Feature Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to set a new end condition for a simple hole
feature.

```vb
 '----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions:
 ' 1. Open a part document containing a block with a simple hole feature named
 '    Hole1.
 ' 2. Select the bottom face of the block.
 ' 3. Open the Immediate window.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1. Sets the bottom face of the block as the new end condition
 '    of the simple hole feature.
 ' 2. Examine the Immediate window.
