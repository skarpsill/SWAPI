# SetConstraintCurves Method (IFillSurfaceFeatureData)

Sets the entities for the constraint curves.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub SetConstraintCurves( _
   ByVal ConstraintVar As System.Object _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFillSurfaceFeatureData
Dim ConstraintVar As System.Object

instance.SetConstraintCurves(ConstraintVar)
```

### C#

```csharp
void SetConstraintCurves(
   System.object ConstraintVar
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void SetConstraintCurves(
   System.Object^ ConstraintVar
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `ConstraintVar`: Array of entities to use to constrain the surface; valid entities are:

- [Edges](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IEdge.html)
- [Sketches](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketch.html)
