Dim TopDoc As System.Object
Dim Component As System.Object
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.AccessSelections(TopDoc, Component)
```

## Remarks

| To modify a feature in a... | Then... |

| Part | TopDoc argument is the IModelDoc2 for the part Component argument is NULL |
| Assembly | TopDoc is the IModelDoc2 object for the assembly Component argument is the IComponent2 object in which the feature is to be modified |

This method puts the model into a rollback state to allow access to the selections that define this feature. You must use either of the following methods to restore the rollback state:

- [IFeature::ModifyDefinition](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html)

  or

  [IFeature::IModifyDefinition2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~IModifyDefinition2.html)

  if you modified the feature
