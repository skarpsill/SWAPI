   ByVal Y As System.Integer, _
   ByVal Flags As System.Integer _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IMouse
Dim X As System.Integer
Dim Y As System.Integer
Dim Flags As System.Integer
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.Move(X, Y, Flags)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool Move(
   System.int X,
   System.int Y,
   System.int Flags
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool Move(
   System.int X,
   System.int Y,
   System.int Flags
)
```

.

### Parameters

- `X`: x coordinate where to move the pointer
- `Y`: y coordinate where to move the pointer
- `Flags`: Mouse command as defined in

[swMouse_e](ms-its:swcommands.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swcommands~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swcommands.swMouse_e.html)

## Remarks

To use this method and access SOLIDWORKS commands, you must add a reference toSOLIDWORKS`version`Commands type library(substitute the actual SOLIDWORKS version number for`version`) or**SolidWorks.Interop.swcommands.dll**, typically installed in`install_dir`**\api\redist.**

In window space, the origin of the coordinate system is the upper-left corner of the window. Positive x is to the right; positive y is down.
