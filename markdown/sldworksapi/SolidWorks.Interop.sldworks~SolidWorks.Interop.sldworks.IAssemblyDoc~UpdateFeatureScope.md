# UpdateFeatureScope Method (IAssemblyDoc)

Updates the feature scope and rebuilds the currently selected assembly feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub UpdateFeatureScope()
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IAssemblyDoc

instance.UpdateFeatureScope()
```

### C#

```csharp
void UpdateFeatureScope()
```

### C++/CLI

```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

## VBA Syntax

See

[AssemblyDoc::UpdateFeatureScope](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~AssemblyDoc~UpdateFeatureScope.html)

.

## Remarks

You can use assembly features to create a feature that affects multiple components in an assembly. For example, if you need a hole through two blocks to bolt them together, you can create a hole as an assembly feature that goes through both of the blocks.
