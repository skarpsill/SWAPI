# Get Body Outline Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to get the outline of a solid body.
This example also creates and inserts a sketch of that outline.

```vb
 '-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions: Open a part document that contains
 '  at least one solid body.
 '
 ' Postconditions: Processes the body outline curves
 ' to remove gaps before sketching the outline.
