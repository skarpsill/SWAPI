# GetTypeName2 Method (IFeature)

Gets the type of feature.

NOTE: Toget the underlying type of feature of an Instant3D feature (i.e., "ICE"), call IFeature::GetTypeName ; otherwise, call this method.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetTypeName2() As System.String
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeature
Dim value As System.String

value = instance.GetTypeName2()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.string GetTypeName2()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.String^ GetTypeName2();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

String identifying the type of feature (see**Remarks**)

## VBA Syntax

See

[Feature::GetTypeName2](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Feature~GetTypeName2.html)

.

## Remarks

Use[IFeature::GetDefinition](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetDefinition.html)to get a feature data object (i.e., an object whose interface name ends in FeatureData or FeatureData2, such as ISymmetricMateFeatureData, IExtrudeFeatureData2, ILoftFeatureData, ISimpleFilletFeatureData2, IChamferFeatureData2, etc.); otherwise, use[IFeature::GetSpecificFeature2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetSpecificFeature2.html)to get an object for a feature.

MateGroup

,

Weldment

, etc.) that set up the design functionality environment and, thus, do not have interfaces.
