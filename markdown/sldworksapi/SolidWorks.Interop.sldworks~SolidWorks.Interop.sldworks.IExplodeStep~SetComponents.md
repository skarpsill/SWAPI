# SetComponents Method (IExplodeStep)

Specifies the components of this explode step.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub SetComponents( _
   ByVal Components As System.Object _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IExplodeStep
Dim Components As System.Object

instance.SetComponents(Components)
```

### C#

```csharp
void SetComponents(
   System.object Components
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void SetComponents(
   System.Object^ Components
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Components`: Array of

[components](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IComponent2.html)

## VBA Syntax

See

[ExplodeStep::SetComponents](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~ExplodeStep~SetComponents.html)

.

## Remarks

Modifying components during editing of this regular explode step modifies the rotational axis if:

- the rotational axis was not provided during creation,

- and -

- the component to which it referred (the last component in the selection list) was removed during editing.

In that case, a rotational axis using the last selected component in the selection list is created.
