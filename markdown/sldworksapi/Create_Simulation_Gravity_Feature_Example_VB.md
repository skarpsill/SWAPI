# Create Simulation Gravity Feature Example (VBA)

This example shows how to create a simulation gravity feature in a motion
study.

```vb
'---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ' Preconditions: kadov_tag{{<spaces>}} kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}
 ' 1. Verify that the specified model document exists.
 ' 2. In SOLIDWORKS, verify that View > MotionManager is selected.
 ' kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}3. In the IDE, click Tools > References and select
 '    SOLIDWORKS version MotionStudy Type library.
 ' 4. Click OK.
 ' 5. Open an Immediate window.
 '
 ' Postconditions:
 ' 1. Adds Gravity to the MotionManager design tree on the Motion Study 1 tab.
 ' 2. Inspect the Immediate window.
 '
 ' NOTE: Because the model is used elsewhere,
 ' do not save changes when closing it.
