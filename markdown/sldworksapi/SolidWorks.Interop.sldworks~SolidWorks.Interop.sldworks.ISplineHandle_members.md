# ISplineHandle Interface Members

The following tables list the members exposed by[ISplineHandle](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISplineHandle.html).

## Public Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Property | Curvature | Gets or sets the degree of curvature at any point where curvature control was added. |
| Property | CurvatureControlled | Gets or sets whether the spline handle has curvature control. |
| Property | Editable | Gets or sets whether this spline handle can be edited. |
| Property | Parameter | Gets value in the parameter space of the curve underlying the spline handle. |
| Property | RadiusOfCurvature | Gets or sets the radius of curvature at any spline point. |
| Property | SplinePointNumber | Gets the number of the points of this spline handle. |
| Property | TangentDriving | Enables or disables spline control using tangent magnitude, tangent radial direction , and tangent polar direction . |
| Property | TangentMagnitude | Gets or sets the weight for the tangency magnitude in the specified direction for this spline handle. |
| Property | TangentPolarDirection | Gets or sets the tangent polar direction, which is the elevation angle of the tangent vector to a plane placed at a point perpendicular to a spline point. |
| Property | TangentRadialDirection | Gets or sets the tangent radial direction, which controls the tangency direction by allowing modification of the spline's angle of inclination relative to the x, y, or z axis. |
| Property | X | Gets or sets the x coordinate of the spline point. |
| Property | Y | Gets or sets the y coordinate of the spline point. |
| Property | Z | Gets or sets the z coordinate of the spline point. |
