# IGetLeaderAtIndex Method (ISFSymbol)

Gets information about the specified leader on this surface finish symbol.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetLeaderAtIndex( _
   ByVal Index As System.Integer, _
   ByRef PointCount As System.Integer _
) As System.Double
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISFSymbol
Dim Index As System.Integer
Dim PointCount As System.Integer
Dim value As System.Double

value = instance.IGetLeaderAtIndex(Index, PointCount)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.double IGetLeaderAtIndex(
   System.int Index,
   out System.int PointCount
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.double IGetLeaderAtIndex(
   System.int Index,
   [Out] System.int PointCount
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Index`: Index of the line where the index begins at 0
- `PointCount`: Number of (x,y,z) points returned in the array

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of doubles (see

  Remarks

  )
- VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

## Remarks

There can be 0, 1 or 2 lines used with the leader line. If the surface-finish sysmbol is not attached then, there are 0 lines; otherwise, you can have a straight leaderline (1 line) or a bent leaderline (2 lines). You must infer the number of leader lines based on[ISFSymbol::IsAttached](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISFSymbol~IsAttached.html)and[ISFSymbol::HasExtraLeader](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISFSymbol~HasExtraLeader.html).

- ISFSymbol::IsAttached == false implies no leaderline and no leaderline points (PointCount=0).
- ISFSymbol::HasExtraLeader == false means that this is a straight leaderline and 1 line (PointCount=2)
- ISFSymbol::HasExtraLeader == true means that this is a bent leaderline and 2 lines (PointCount=3)

Format of return information is the following array of doubles:

(Table)=========================================================

|  | retval [0] = x-coordinate of first leader point |
| --- | --- |
|  | retval [1] = y-coordinate of first leader point |
|  | retval [2] = z-coordinate of first leader point |
|  |  |
|  | retval [3] = x-coordinate of second leader point |
|  | retval [4] = y-coordinate of second leader point |
|  | retval [5] = z-coordinate of second leader point |
|  |  |
|  | retval [6] = x-coordinate of third leader point |
|  | retval [7] = y-coordinate of third leader point |
|  | retval [8] = z-coordinate of third leader point |

Use[ISFSymbol::GetLeaderCount](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISFSymbol~GetLeaderCount.html)to see how many leaders there are on the[ISFSymbol](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISFSymbol.html)object.
