# CreateLine2 Method (IModelDoc2)

Obsolete. Superseded by

[SketchManager::CreateLine](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchManager~CreateLine.html)

.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function CreateLine2( _
   ByVal P1x As System.Double, _
   ByVal P1y As System.Double, _
   ByVal P1z As System.Double, _
   ByVal P2x As System.Double, _
   ByVal P2y As System.Double, _
   ByVal P2z As System.Double _
) As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IModelDoc2
Dim P1x As System.Double
Dim P1y As System.Double
Dim P1z As System.Double
Dim P2x As System.Double
Dim P2y As System.Double
Dim P2z As System.Double
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.CreateLine2(P1x, P1y, P1z, P2x, P2y, P2z)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object CreateLine2(
   System.double P1x,
   System.double P1y,
   System.double P1z,
   System.double P2x,
   System.double P2y,
   System.double P2z
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ CreateLine2(
   System.double P1x,
   System.double P1y,
   System.double P1z,
   System.double P2x,
   System.double P2y,
   System.double P2z
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `P1x`: X value of the line start point
- `P1y`: Y value of the line start point
- `P1z`: Z value of the line start point
- `P2x`: X value of the line end point
- `P2y`: Y value of the line end point
- `P2z`: Z value of the line end point

### Return Value

Newly created sketch line

## VBA Syntax

See

[ModelDoc2::CreateLine2](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~ModelDoc2~CreateLine2.html)

## Remarks

If a sketch is not active, then the line is not created and NULL is returned. You can check for an active sketch using[IModelDoc2::GetActiveSketch2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~GetActiveSketch2.html)or[IModelDoc2::IGetActiveSketch2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~IGetActiveSketch2.html).

For COM applications, the underlying[ISketchLine](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchLine.html)object can be obtained using QueryInterface on the[ISketchSegment](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchSegment.html)object returned. C++ Dispatch applications can define a new ISketchLine or ISketchSegment object that uses this Dispatch pointer. Visual Basic applications interpret the pointer for you automatically so you can use the returned object to call ISketchSegment or ISketchLine functions.

[IModelDoc2::SetAddToDB](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~SetAddToDB.html)and[IModelDoc2::SetDisplayWhenAdded](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~SetDisplayWhenAdded.html)increase performance during entity creation by adding entities directly to the SOLIDWORKS database. IModelDoc2::SetAddToDB also avoids inferencing.

When this method is used with a drawing document, this method creates the line relative to the active drawing view,[IDrawingDoc::ActiveDrawingView](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IDrawingDoc~ActiveDrawingView.html)or[IDrawingDoc::IActiveDrawingView](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IDrawingDoc~IActiveDrawingView.html).
