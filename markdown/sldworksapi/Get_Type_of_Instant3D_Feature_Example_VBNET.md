# Get Type of Instant3D Feature Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to get the types and persistent IDs of underlying features of Instant3D
features.

'----------------------------------------------------- ' Preconditions: ' 1. Verify that the specified part exists. ' 2. Open the Immediate window. ' ' Postconditions: ' 1. Opens the part and traverses the FeatureManager ' design tree. ' 2. Gets the types of features, including the types ' of underlying features and the persistent ' IDs of Instant3Dfeatures. ' 3. Examine the Immediate window.
