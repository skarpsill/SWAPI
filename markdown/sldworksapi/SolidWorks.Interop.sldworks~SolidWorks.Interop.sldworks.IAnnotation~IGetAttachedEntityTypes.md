# IGetAttachedEntityTypes Method (IAnnotation)

Gets the types of all entities attached to this annotation.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetAttachedEntityTypes() As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IAnnotation
Dim value As System.Integer

value = instance.IGetAttachedEntityTypes()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int IGetAttachedEntityTypes()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.int IGetAttachedEntityTypes();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

- in-process, in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of longs that indicate the types of all entities attached to this annotation as defined in

  [swSelectType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swSelectType_e.html)

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

## Remarks

This method supports all annotation types. Use[IAnnotation::GetType](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IAnnotation~GetType.html)to determine the annotation type.

This method returns an array of longs or integersindicating object types. The list of object types corresponds to the list of objects returned by[IAnnotation::IGetAttachedEntities](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IAnnotation~IGetAttachedEntities.html).

You can associate annotations with additional items not listed in[swSelectType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swSelectType_e.html). If this annotation is attached to one or more entities not listed in swSelectType_e, then this method and[IAnnotation::GetAttachedEntityTypes](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IAnnotation~GetAttachedEntityTypes.html)return swSelNOTHING in a position in the array corresponding to the unlisted item.kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}IAnnotation::IGetAttachedEntities indicates an unsupported entity by returning a null value in the position in the array corresponding to the unsupported entity. COM applications that call[IAnnotation::GetAttachedEntityCount3](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IAnnotation~GetAttachedEntityCount3.html)include the null value in the total count of associated entities.

If an annotation is disassociated from its geometry (i.e., dangling), then IAnnotation::IGetAttachedEntities returns a null value in the position in the array corresponding to the dangling item, and this method returns swSelNOTHING in the position in the array corresponding to the dangling item.

NOTE:If this annotation is not associated with any geometry, then this method and IAnnotation::IGetAttachedEntities return empty arrays.
