# ICreateTransform Method (IMathUtility)

Creates a new math transform.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function ICreateTransform( _
   ByRef ArrayDataIn As System.Double _
) As MathTransform
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IMathUtility
Dim ArrayDataIn As System.Double
Dim value As MathTransform

value = instance.ICreateTransform(ArrayDataIn)
```

### C#

```csharp
MathTransform ICreateTransform(
   ref System.double ArrayDataIn
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
MathTransform^ ICreateTransform(
   System.double% ArrayDataIn
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `ArrayDataIn`: - in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to sixteen (16) components of the transform (see

  Remarks

  )

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

### Return Value

Newly created[math transform](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IMathTransform.html)or null if the operation fails

## VBA Syntax

See

[MathUtility::ICreateTransform](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~MathUtility~ICreateTransform.html)

.

## Remarks

Transformation matrix data:

|a b c . n |

|d e f . o |

|g h i . p |

|j k l . m |

The SOLIDWORKS transformation matrix is stored as a homogeneous matrix of 16 elements, ordered as shown. The first 9 elements(a to i)are elements of a 3x3 rotational sub-matrix, the next 3 elements(j,k,l)define a translation vector, and the next 1 element(m)is a scaling factor. The last 3 elements(n,o,p)are unused in this context.

The 3x3 rotational sub-matrix represents 3 axis sets:

- row 1 for x-axis components of rotation
- row 2 for y-axis components of rotation
- row 3 for z-axis components of rotation

The 3 axes are constrained to be orthogonal and unified so that they produce a pure rotational transformation. Reflections can also be added to these axes by setting the components to negative. The rotation sub-matrix coupled with the lower-left translation vector and the lower-right corner scaling factor creates an affine transformation, which is a transformation that preserves lines and parallelism; i.e., maps parallel lines to parallel lines.

If the 3 axis sets of the 3x3 rotational sub-matrix are not orthogonal or unified, then they are automatically corrected according to the following rules:

- If any axis is 0, or any two axes are parallel, or all axes are coplanar, then an identity matrix replaces the rotational sub-matrix.
- All axes are corrected to be of unit length.
- The axes are built to be orthogonal to each other in the prioritized order of Z, X, Y (X is orthogonal to Z, Y is orthogonal to Z and X).
