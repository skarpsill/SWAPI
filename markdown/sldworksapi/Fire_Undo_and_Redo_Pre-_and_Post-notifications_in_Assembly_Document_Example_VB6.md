# Fire Undo and Redo Pre- and Post-notifications in Assembly Document (VBA)

This example shows how to fire Undo and Redo pre- and post-notifications
in an assembly document.

```
'-----------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open public_documents\samples\tutorial\smartcomponents\stepped_shaft.sldasm.
' 2. Copy and paste Main into the main module.
' 3. Click Insert > Class Module and copy and paste Class1 into that module.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Selects  and hides the base-plate<1> component and
'    fires pre- and post-notifications indicating that an
'    Undo has occurred.
' 2. Performs a Redo and fires pre- and post-notifications.
' 3. Performs another Undo and fires pre- and post-notifications
'    so that the assembly document returns to its just-opened state.
' 4. Click OK to close each message box.
'
' NOTE: Because the assembly is used elsewhere, do not save changes.
