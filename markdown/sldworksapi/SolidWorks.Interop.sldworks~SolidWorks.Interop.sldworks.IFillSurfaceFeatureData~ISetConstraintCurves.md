# ISetConstraintCurves Method (IFillSurfaceFeatureData)

Sets the entities for the constraint curves.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub ISetConstraintCurves( _
   ByVal Count As System.Integer, _
   ByRef DispArr As System.Object _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFillSurfaceFeatureData
Dim Count As System.Integer
Dim DispArr As System.Object

instance.ISetConstraintCurves(Count, DispArr)
```

### C#

```csharp
void ISetConstraintCurves(
   System.int Count,
   ref System.object DispArr
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void ISetConstraintCurves(
   System.int Count,
   System.Object^% DispArr
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Count`: Number of entities to use to constrain the surface
- `DispArr`: - in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an rray of entities to use to constrain the surface; valid entities are:

  - [edges](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IEdge.html)
  - [sketches](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketch.html)
- VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported
