## VBA Syntax

[FileOpenPreNotify Event (SldWorks)](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/SldWorks~SldWorks~FileOpenPreNotify_EV.html)

.

## Remarks

This event is only fired when opening these SOLIDWORKS files: parts, drawings, and assemblies. It is not fired when opening files like templates, translator files, and so on.

This event is fired before SOLIDWORKS begins loading the file. A SOLIDWORKS file can be opened in many ways; for example,File,Openin the user interface,[ISldWorks::OpenDoc6](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~OpenDoc6.html)in the API, Load Model from a Detached drawing, Lightweight component being resolved, and so on. This event is fired in all of these cases.

If you want to allow SOLIDWORKS to open the file, return S_OK (or 0) from the handler. If you do not want to allow SOLIDWORKS to open the file, return S_false (or any code other than S_OK) from the handler.

The event that occurs after this event is[DocumentLoadNotify](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.DSldWorksEvents_DocumentLoadNotifyEventHandler.html).

If developing a C++ application, use[swAppFileOpenPreNotify](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swAppNotify_e.html)to register for this notification.
