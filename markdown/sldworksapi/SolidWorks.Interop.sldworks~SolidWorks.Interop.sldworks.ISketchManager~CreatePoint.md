   ByVal Y As System.Double, _
   ByVal Z As System.Double _
) As SketchPoint
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISketchManager
Dim X As System.Double
Dim Y As System.Double
Dim Z As System.Double
Dim value As SketchPoint

value = instance.CreatePoint(X, Y, Z)
```

### C#

```csharp
SketchPoint CreatePoint(
   System.double X,
   System.double Y,
   System.double Z
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp

   System.double X,
   System.double Y,
   System.double Z
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

## Remarks

This method creates a point in the active 2D or 3D sketch. If a sketch is not active, the point is not created and NULL is returned. Use[ISketchManager::ActiveSketch](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchManager~ActiveSketch.html)to check to see if the sketch is active.

[ISketchManager::AddToDB](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchManager~AddToDB.html)and[ISketchManager::DisplayWhenAdded](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISketchManager~DisplayWhenAdded.html)increase performance during entity creation by adding entities directly to the SOLIDWORKS database. ISketchManager::AddToDB also avoids inferencing.
