# Constrain Sketch Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to fully constrain a sketch.

(Table)=========================================================

| Before constraining the sketch | After constraining the sketch |

```
'----------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions: Before constraining the sketch sketch exists.
'
' Postconditions: Fully constrains the sketch, which looks like
' After constraining the sketch.
