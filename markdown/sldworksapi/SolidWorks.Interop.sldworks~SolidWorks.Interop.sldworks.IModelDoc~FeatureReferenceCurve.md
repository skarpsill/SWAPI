.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function FeatureReferenceCurve( _
   ByVal NumOfCurves As System.Integer, _
   ByVal BaseCurves As System.Object, _
   ByVal Merge As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal FromFileName As System.String, _

Dim ErrorCode As System.Integer
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.FeatureReferenceCurve(NumOfCurves, BaseCurves, Merge, FromFileName, ErrorCode)
```

System.object FeatureReferenceCurve(
   System.int NumOfCurves,
   System.object BaseCurves,
   System.bool Merge,
   System.string FromFileName,
   out System.int ErrorCode
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ FeatureReferenceCurve(
   System.int NumOfCurves,
   System.Object^ BaseCurves,
   System.bool Merge,
   System.String^ FromFileName,
   [Out] System.int ErrorCode
)
```
