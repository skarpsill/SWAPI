# IGetArrowInfo Method (IDrSection)

Gets the position of the arrows for this section line.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IGetArrowInfo() As System.Double
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IDrSection
Dim value As System.Double

value = instance.IGetArrowInfo()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.double IGetArrowInfo()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.double IGetArrowInfo();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

- in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (see

  Remarks

  )

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

## Remarks

The section line in a drawing view has arrows at each end of the line. This method returns an array that consists of 12 doubles, the (X, Y, Z) of the start and end point of one arrow followed by the (X, Y, Z) of the start and end point of the other arrow.

These values are the same as some of the information in the array returned by View::GetSectionLineInfo. The arrow information in that array also contains the arrow width, height and style. That information is not included in the array returned by this method, but you can get it from the document preference settings because these values are controlled only at the document level, not on an individual section line basis.
