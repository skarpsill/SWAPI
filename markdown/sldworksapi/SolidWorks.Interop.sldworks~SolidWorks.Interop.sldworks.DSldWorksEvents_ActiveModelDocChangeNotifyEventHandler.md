## VBA Syntax

See

.

## Remarks

The active[IModelDoc2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2.html)object represents the document that is currently being edited by the end-user. This notification is not sent when a part or subassembly is being edited in the context of an assembly. On receiving this event, you can call[ISldWorks::ActiveDoc](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~ActiveDoc.html)or[ISldWorks:IActiveDoc2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~IActiveDoc2.html)to get the actual IModelDoc2 pointer.

This event is only sent when the active window in the SOLIDWORKS session actually changes to a new active model document. Window changes are not guaranteed during, for example, the shutdown of the SOLIDWORKS application. For example, if the SOLIDWORKS application closes a non-active document, there is no need to activate a new document window.

If developing a C++ application, use

[swAppModelDocChangeNotify](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swAppNotify_e.html)

to register for this notification.
