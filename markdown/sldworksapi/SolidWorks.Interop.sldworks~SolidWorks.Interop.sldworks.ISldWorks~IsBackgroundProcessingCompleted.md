Function IsBackgroundProcessingCompleted( _
   ByVal FilePath As System.String _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISldWorks
Dim FilePath As System.String
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.IsBackgroundProcessingCompleted(FilePath)
```

### C#

```csharp

   System.string FilePath
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool IsBackgroundProcessingCompleted(
   System.String^ FilePath
)
```

## Remarks

SOLIDWORKS recommends that you only use this method with[ISldWorks::EnableBackgroundProcessing](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks~EnableBackgroundProcessing.html)and[IDrawingDoc::BackgroundProcessingOption](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IDrawingDoc~BackgroundProcessingOption.html)when you can quickly open a drawing document via the user interface, but that same drawing takes significantly more time to open programmatically.

To more efficiently and programmatically open a drawing document that requires a lot of CPU time and no user input:
