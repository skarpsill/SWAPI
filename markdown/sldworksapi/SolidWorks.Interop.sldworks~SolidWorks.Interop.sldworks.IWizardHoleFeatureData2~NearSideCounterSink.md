# NearSideCounterSink Property (IWizardHoleFeatureData2)

Gets whether the near side option is selected for the Hole Wizard countersink feature.

**NOTE: This property is a get-only property. Set is not implemented.**

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property NearSideCounterSink As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IWizardHoleFeatureData2
Dim value As System.Boolean

instance.NearSideCounterSink = value

value = instance.NearSideCounterSink
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool NearSideCounterSink {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.bool NearSideCounterSink {
   System.bool get();
   void set (    System.bool value);
}
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Property Value

True if the near side option for the countersink Hole Wizard feature is selected, false if not (see

Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

See

[WizardHoleFeatureData2::NearSideCounterSink](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~WizardHoleFeatureData2~NearSideCounterSink.html)

.

## Examples

[Select Near and Far Side Hole Wizard Countersink Options (C#)](Select_Near_and_Far_Side_Countersink_Hole_Options_Example_CSharp.htm)

[Select Near and Far Side Hole Wizard Countersink Options (VB.NET)](Select_Near_and_Far_Side_Countersink_Hole_Options_Example_VBNET.htm)

[Select Near and Far Side Hole Wizard Countersink Options (VBA)](Select_Near_and_Far_Side_Countersink_Hole_Options_Example_VB.htm)

## Remarks

If you set this property to true, you must also set

[IWizardHoleFeatureData2::NearCounterSinkDiameter](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IWizardHoleFeatureData2~NearCounterSinkDiameter.html)

to an appropriate value in meters and

[IWizardHoleFeatureData2::NearCounterSinkAngle](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IWizardHoleFeatureData2~NearCounterSinkAngle.html)

to an appropriate value in radians to modify the Hole Wizard feature definition. If you do not set the diameter and angle to their proper values, then this method has no effect.
