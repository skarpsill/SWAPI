) As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `paintType`: Valid paint type as defined in

[swRepaintTypes_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swRepaintTypes_e.html)

(only the first two types are supported)

## VBA Syntax

See

[RepaintNotify Event (ModelView)](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/SldWorks~ModelView~RepaintNotify_EV.html)

.

## Remarks

Returns S_false to stop from proceeding with the action that caused the notification. This also prevents sending the IModelView[BufferSwapNotify](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.DModelViewEvents_BufferSwapNotifyEventHandler.html)event.

If developing a C++ application, use[swViewBufferSwapNotify](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swViewNotify_e.html)to register for this notification.
