# Create Compound Note Example (VBA)

This example shows how to create a compound
note in a drawing document.

```
'----------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open public_documents\samples\tutorial\api\2012-sm.slddrw.
' 2. Click the letter E in the drawing view.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Creates a compound note.
' 2. Click the compound note and drag it to a different
'    location in the drawing.
'
' NOTE: Because this drawing is used elsewhere, do not save
' changes.
