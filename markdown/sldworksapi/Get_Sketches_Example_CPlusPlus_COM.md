# Get Sketches Example (C++ COM)

If you use a sketch to create a feature on
your solid body, that sketch is a subfeature of that solid feature. This
is illustrated by expanding and examining the FeatureManager design tree
of a SOLIDWORKS feature.

This example shows how to traverse the FeatureManager
design tree and use subfeature traversal to grab the ISketch objects used
by each feature.

// Precompiled header

#include "stdafx.h"

#include <mbstring.h>

// SOLIDWORKS includes

#include <amapp.h>

// User Dll includes

#include "userapp.h"

{

LPMODELDOC pModelDoc;

HRESULT hres = UserApp->getSWApp()->get_IActiveDoc( &pModelDoc );

LPFEATURE pFeature = NULL;

// Get first feature in document

hres = pModelDoc->IFirstFeature(&pFeature);

int count = 0;

// While features exist

while (pFeature)

{

BSTR bFeatName;

// Get the feature name

hres = pFeature->get_Name(
&bFeatName );

CString featName(
bFeatName );

CString message;

message.Format(
_T("\n\nFeature: %s"), bFeatName);

LPFEATURE pSubFeat;

// Get the subfeature

hres = pFeature->IGetFirstSubFeature( &pSubFeat );

!= NULL)

// Print to Debug Output

TRACE1("%s",message);

// Popup dialog for Release

// AfxMessageBox(

while ( pSubFeat
)

{

BSTR bFeatureTypeName;

// Get the subfeature type

hres = pSubFeat->GetTypeName(&bFeatureTypeName);

CString featureTypeName(bFeatureTypeName);

// If the sub-feature is
a Sketch

== "ProfileFeature")

{

LPUNKNOWN iUnk

// Now that you have the Sketch used by this

a sketch
