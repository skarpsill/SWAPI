.

### Property Value

0.0 <= offset <= 1.0

## VBA Syntax

See

[SMNormalCutFeatureData::Offset](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~SMNormalCutFeatureData~Offset.html)

.

## Examples

See the

[IFeatureManager::AddSMNormalCutType](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~AddSMNormalCutType.html)

example.

## Remarks

This property allows you to adjust the profile of the Normal Cut. Setting this property to 0.0 sets the profile to the circular edge on one side of the body. Setting it to 1.0 sets the profile to the circular edge on the opposite side of the body. A value in between 0.0 and 1.0 sets the profile to a circular edge somewhere in the middle of the body.
