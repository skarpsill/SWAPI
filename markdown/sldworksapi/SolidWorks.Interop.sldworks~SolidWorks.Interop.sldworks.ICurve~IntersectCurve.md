# IntersectCurve Method (ICurve)

Gets a set of points that represent the intersection of two trimmed curves.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IntersectCurve( _
   ByVal OtherCurve As System.Object, _
   ByVal ThisStartPoint As System.Object, _
   ByVal ThisEndPoint As System.Object, _
   ByVal OtherStartPoint As System.Object, _
   ByVal OtherEndPoint As System.Object _
) As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICurve
Dim OtherCurve As System.Object
Dim ThisStartPoint As System.Object
Dim ThisEndPoint As System.Object
Dim OtherStartPoint As System.Object
Dim OtherEndPoint As System.Object
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.IntersectCurve(OtherCurve, ThisStartPoint, ThisEndPoint, OtherStartPoint, OtherEndPoint)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object IntersectCurve(
   System.object OtherCurve,
   System.object ThisStartPoint,
   System.object ThisEndPoint,
   System.object OtherStartPoint,
   System.object OtherEndPoint
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ IntersectCurve(
   System.Object^ OtherCurve,
   System.Object^ ThisStartPoint,
   System.Object^ ThisEndPoint,
   System.Object^ OtherStartPoint,
   System.Object^ OtherEndPoint
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `OtherCurve`: Curve to intersect with this

[curve](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ICurve.html)
- `ThisStartPoint`: Array containing the start point of this curve
- `ThisEndPoint`: Array containing the end point of this curve
- `OtherStartPoint`: Array containing the start point of otherCurve
- `OtherEndPoint`: Array containing the end point of otherCurve

### Return Value

Array containing the intersection points (see

Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

See

[Curve::IntersectCurve](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~Curve~IntersectCurve.html)

.

## Remarks

The array of doubles returned contains the x, y, z location of the tessellation points and a code for each point that indicates the intersection class:

[x1, y1, z1, k1, x2, y2, z2, k2....]

Return codes are defined in[swIntersectionType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swIntersectionType_e.html).
