## Remarks

In Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), the view argument is a VARIANT of type SafeArray of 16 doubles:

(Table)=========================================================

| Elements | Values |
| --- | --- |
| First 9 | Standard 3x3 rotation matrix |
| Next 3 | Define translation |
| Next 1 | For scaling |
| Last 3 | Not used |

Your application is responsible for destroying the SafeArray when you are finished with it.

If developing a C++ application, use[swViewChangeNotify](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swViewNotify_e.html)to register for this notification.
