## Remarks

A universal joint (U-joint) mate consists of two components where the rotation of one component (the output shaft) about its axis is driven by the rotation of another component (the input shaft) about its axis. An example would be the U-joint between the transmission and the rear drive axle of an automobile.

[IMateFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IMateFeatureData.html)is the parent of this mate interface.

To create a universal joint mate:

1. Follow general instructions in the

  [IAssemblyDoc::CreateMate](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IAssemblyDoc~CreateMate.html)

  Remarks.
2. Specify

  [IUniversalJointMateFeatureData::EntitiesToMate](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IUniversalJointMateFeatureData~EntitiesToMate.html)

  or use

  [IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~SelectByID2.html)

  to pre-select the entities using Mark = 1.
3. Set

  [IUniversalJointMateFeatureData::DefineJointPoint](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IUniversalJointMateFeatureData~DefineJointPoint.html)

  to true and specify

  [IUniversalJointMateFeatureData::JointPoint](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IUniversalJointMateFeatureData~JointPoint.html)

  or use IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2 to pre-select the joint point using Mark = 16384.
4. Specify other properties of the UniversalJointMateFeatureData object as required.

To edit a universal joint mate:

1. Access its feature and call

  [IFeature::GetDefinition](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetDefinition.html)

  to get the MateFeatureData object.
2. Cast the MateFeatureData object to a UniversalJointMateFeatureData object.
3. Modify the UniversalJointMateFeatureData object.
4. Call

  [IFeature::ModifyDefinition](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html)

  .

To delete this universal joint mate, use[IModelDocExtension::DeleteSelection2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~DeleteSelection2.html).
