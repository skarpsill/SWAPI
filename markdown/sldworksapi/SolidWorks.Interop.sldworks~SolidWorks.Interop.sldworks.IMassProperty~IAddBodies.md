# IAddBodies Method (IMassProperty)

Uses only the specified bodies when calculating the mass properties for this model.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function IAddBodies( _
   ByVal NumBodies As System.Integer, _
   ByRef BodyListIn As Body2 _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IMassProperty
Dim NumBodies As System.Integer
Dim BodyListIn As Body2
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.IAddBodies(NumBodies, BodyListIn)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool IAddBodies(
   System.int NumBodies,
   ref Body2 BodyListIn
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool IAddBodies(
   System.int NumBodies,
   Body2^% BodyListIn
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `NumBodies`: Number of bodies in the model
- `BodyListIn`: - in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of

  [bodies](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IBody2.html)

  in the model of size NumBodies

VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported

See[In-process Methods](sldworksapiprogguide.chm::/OVERVIEW/In-process_Methods.htm)for details about this type of method.

### Return Value

True if the specified bodies are used for calculating mass properties, false if not

## Remarks

This method lets you select which solid bodies to use when calculating mass properties, much like a end-user selecting the bodies via the interface.

NOTE:If a sheet (surface) body is specified, it is ignored and false is returned.

The results of the mass property calculations vary based on whether or not this method is used.kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}

(Table)=========================================================

| If this method is... | Then... |
| --- | --- |
| Called and bodies are specified | These bodies can either be from a subset of the documents body list or from temporary bodies. NOTE: Each specified body should either come from the owning document or be a temporary body. If the body does not satisfy either case, then it is not used when calculating the mass properties. |
| Not called | Mass properties' calculations include all available bodies in the document. Part . All of the solid bodies are included in the calculations. Assembly . All of the bodies in all of the components are used in the calculations. |

If the document from which the MassProperty object came is an assembly, then any body from any of the child components can be used. To obtain the body, call[IComponent2::GetBodies2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IComponent2~GetBodies2.html). Your application does not need to make a copy of the body or apply a transform to the body.
