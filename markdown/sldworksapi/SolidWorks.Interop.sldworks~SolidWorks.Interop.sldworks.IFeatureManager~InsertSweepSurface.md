.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function InsertSweepSurface( _
   ByVal Propagate As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal TwistCtrlOption As System.Short, _
   ByVal KeepTangency As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal ForceNonRational As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal StartMatchingType As System.Short, _
   ByVal EndMatchingType As System.Short, _
   ByVal PathAlign As System.Short _
) As Feature
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeatureManager
Dim Propagate As System.Boolean
Dim TwistCtrlOption As System.Short
Dim KeepTangency As System.Boolean
Dim ForceNonRational As System.Boolean
Dim StartMatchingType As System.Short
Dim EndMatchingType As System.Short
Dim PathAlign As System.Short
Dim value As Feature

value = instance.InsertSweepSurface(Propagate, TwistCtrlOption, KeepTangency, ForceNonRational, StartMatchingType, EndMatchingType, PathAlign)
```

### C#

```csharp
Feature InsertSweepSurface(
   System.bool Propagate,
   System.short TwistCtrlOption,
   System.bool KeepTangency,
   System.bool ForceNonRational,
   System.short StartMatchingType,
   System.short EndMatchingType,
   System.short PathAlign
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Feature^ InsertSweepSurface(
   System.bool Propagate,
   System.short TwistCtrlOption,
   System.bool KeepTangency,
   System.bool ForceNonRational,

   System.short EndMatchingType,
   System.short PathAlign
)
```
