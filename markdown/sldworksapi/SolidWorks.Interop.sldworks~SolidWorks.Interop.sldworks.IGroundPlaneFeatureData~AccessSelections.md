# AccessSelections Method (IGroundPlaneFeatureData)

Gains access to the selections that define this ground plane feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function AccessSelections( _
   ByVal TopDoc As System.Object, _
   ByVal Component As System.Object _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IGroundPlaneFeatureData
Dim TopDoc As System.Object
Dim Component As System.Object
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.AccessSelections(TopDoc, Component)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool AccessSelections(
   System.object TopDoc,
   System.object Component
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool AccessSelections(
   System.Object^ TopDoc,
   System.Object^ Component
)
```

NOTE:

- `TopDoc`: Top-level document (see

Remarks

)
- `Component`: Component in which the feature is to be modified (see

Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax
