# GetPointMemberPairs Method (ISecondaryMemberUpToMembersFeatureData)

Gets the point-member pair(s) used to create one or more secondary structure system up-to members.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Sub GetPointMemberPairs( _
   ByRef Points As System.Object, _
   ByRef Members As System.Object, _
   ByRef PointTypes As System.Object _
)
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISecondaryMemberUpToMembersFeatureData
Dim Points As System.Object
Dim Members As System.Object
Dim PointTypes As System.Object

instance.GetPointMemberPairs(Points, Members, PointTypes)
```

### C#

```csharp
void GetPointMemberPairs(
   out System.object Points,
   out System.object Members,
   out System.object PointTypes
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
void GetPointMemberPairs(
   [Out] System.Object^ Points,
   [Out] System.Object^ Members,
   [Out] System.Object^ PointTypes
)
```
