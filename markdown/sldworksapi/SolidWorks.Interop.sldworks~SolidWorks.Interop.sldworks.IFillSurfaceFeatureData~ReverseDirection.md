## Remarks

When patching a solid with a fill surface, there are often two possible results. Use this method to reverse direction while merging results if the fill surface displays in an unwanted direction. See[IFillSurfaceFeatureData::Merge](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFillSurfaceFeatureData~Merge.html)for details about merging results.
