.

### Parameters

- `NewTitle`: Name to give to the document window

### Return Value

True if successfully renamed, false otherwise

## VBA Syntax

See

[ModelDoc2::SetTitle2](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~ModelDoc2~SetTitle2.html)

.

## Remarks

This title appears in the active window's title bar.

This method:

- Does not save this model document to disk; instead, it renames the document window.
- Is only valid when for a new document that has not yet been saved.
- Does not change the title of a document that has already been saved and exists on disk. If you want to rename an existing document, use ModelDoc2::SaveAs.

To retrieve the title of a document, use[IModelDoc2::GetTitle](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~GetTitle.html).
