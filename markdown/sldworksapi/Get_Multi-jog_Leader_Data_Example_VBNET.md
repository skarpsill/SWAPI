# Get Multi-jog Leader Data Example (VB.NET)

This example shows how to get data for a multi-jog leader.

```
'-----------------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open a drawing document with at least one multi-jog leader.
' 2. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Selects a multi-jog leader.
' 2. Gets data for the multi-jog leader.
