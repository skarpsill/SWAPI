# SetNetBlendDirectionData Method (IFeatureManager)

Sets the curve set data (one for each of the two directions) for this boundary feature or boundary surface feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function SetNetBlendDirectionData( _
   ByVal Direction As System.Short, _
   ByVal InfluenceType As System.Short, _
   ByVal TrimCurves As System.Short, _
   ByVal BlendClosed As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal SplitSurfaces As System.Boolean _
) As Feature
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeatureManager
Dim Direction As System.Short
Dim InfluenceType As System.Short
Dim TrimCurves As System.Short
Dim BlendClosed As System.Boolean
Dim SplitSurfaces As System.Boolean
Dim value As Feature

value = instance.SetNetBlendDirectionData(Direction, InfluenceType, TrimCurves, BlendClosed, SplitSurfaces)
```

### C#

```csharp
Feature SetNetBlendDirectionData(
   System.short Direction,
   System.short InfluenceType,
   System.short TrimCurves,
   System.bool BlendClosed,
   System.bool SplitSurfaces
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Feature^ SetNetBlendDirectionData(
   System.short Direction,
   System.short InfluenceType,
   System.short TrimCurves,
   System.bool BlendClosed,
   System.bool SplitSurfaces
)
```

NOTE:

.

### Parameters

- `Direction`: - 0 = Direction 1
- 1 = Direction 2
- `InfluenceType`: - 0 = Global
- 1 = To Next Curve
- 2 = To Next Sharp
- 3 = To Next Edge
- `TrimCurves`: - 0 = False to trim curves
- 1 = True to trim curves
- `BlendClosed`: True closes this boundary feature or boundary surface feature, false leaves this boundary feature or boundary surface feature open
- `SplitSurfaces`: Not used
