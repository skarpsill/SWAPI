# SetFeatureScope Method (ILinearPatternFeatureData)

Sets the feature scope, whether to autoselect the affected bodies, and the affected bodies in this linear pattern feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function SetFeatureScope( _
   ByVal FeatureScopeOption As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal AutoSelectBodies As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal Bodies As System.Object _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ILinearPatternFeatureData
Dim FeatureScopeOption As System.Boolean
Dim AutoSelectBodies As System.Boolean
Dim Bodies As System.Object
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.SetFeatureScope(FeatureScopeOption, AutoSelectBodies, Bodies)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool SetFeatureScope(
   System.bool FeatureScopeOption,
   System.bool AutoSelectBodies,
   System.object Bodies
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool SetFeatureScope(
   System.bool FeatureScopeOption,
   System.bool AutoSelectBodies,
   System.Object^ Bodies
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `FeatureScopeOption`: True to specify affected bodies, false to apply the pattern to all bodies every time the feature regenerates (see

Remarks

)
- `AutoSelectBodies`: True to automatically select all bodies intersected by this pattern feature, false to specify affected bodies (see

Remarks

)
- `Bodies`: Array of

[bodies](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IBody2.html)

to be affected; valid only if FeatureScopeOption is true and AutoSelectBodies is false

### Return Value

True if feature scope set successfully, false if not (see

Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

See

[LinearPatternFeatureData::SetFeatureScope](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~LinearPatternFeatureData~SetFeatureScope.html)

.

## Remarks

If this method returns false, then default values for FeatureScopeOption and AutoSelectBodies are set. A subsequent call to[IFeatureManager::CreateFeature](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~CreateFeature.html)creates the feature with a FeatureScopeOption of true and an AutoSelectBodies of true.

After calling IFeature::ModifyDefinition, call[IFeature::GetErrorCode2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetErrorCode2.html)to determine what's wrong and then take necessary remedial action.

For more information, see the**Linear Patterns and the Linear Pattern PropertyManager**topic in the SOLIDWORKS user-interface help.
