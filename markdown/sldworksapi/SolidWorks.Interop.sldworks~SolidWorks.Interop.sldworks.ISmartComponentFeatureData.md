## Remarks

A Smart Component is defined by:

- Components
- Features
- Feature references

A Smart Component is created in a training assembly. When the Smart Component is saved, it is saved with the training assembly in a SOLIDWORKS part.

When the Smart Component is inserted or edited in a target assembly, the training assembly opens in a small preview window, and the PropertyManager page of the Smart Component displays.

See the SOLIDWORKS Help for more information about Smart Components.
