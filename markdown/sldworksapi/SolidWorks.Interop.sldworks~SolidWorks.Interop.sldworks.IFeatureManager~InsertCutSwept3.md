# InsertCutSwept3 Method (IFeatureManager)

Obsolete. Superseded by

[IFeatureManager::InsertCutSwept4](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager~InsertCutSwept4.html)

.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function InsertCutSwept3( _
   ByVal Propagate As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal Alignment As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal TwistCtrlOption As System.Short, _
   ByVal KeepTangency As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal BAdvancedSmoothing As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal StartMatchingType As System.Short, _
   ByVal EndMatchingType As System.Short, _
   ByVal IsThinBody As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal Thickness1 As System.Double, _
   ByVal Thickness2 As System.Double, _
   ByVal ThinType As System.Short, _
   ByVal PathAlign As System.Short, _
   ByVal UseFeatScope As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal UseAutoSelect As System.Boolean, _
   ByVal TwistAngle As System.Double, _
   ByVal BMergeSmoothFaces As System.Boolean _
) As Feature
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IFeatureManager
Dim Propagate As System.Boolean
Dim Alignment As System.Boolean
Dim TwistCtrlOption As System.Short
Dim KeepTangency As System.Boolean
Dim BAdvancedSmoothing As System.Boolean
Dim StartMatchingType As System.Short
Dim EndMatchingType As System.Short
Dim IsThinBody As System.Boolean
Dim Thickness1 As System.Double
Dim Thickness2 As System.Double
Dim ThinType As System.Short
Dim PathAlign As System.Short
Dim UseFeatScope As System.Boolean
Dim UseAutoSelect As System.Boolean
Dim TwistAngle As System.Double
Dim BMergeSmoothFaces As System.Boolean
Dim value As Feature

value = instance.InsertCutSwept3(Propagate, Alignment, TwistCtrlOption, KeepTangency, BAdvancedSmoothing, StartMatchingType, EndMatchingType, IsThinBody, Thickness1, Thickness2, ThinType, PathAlign, UseFeatScope, UseAutoSelect, TwistAngle, BMergeSmoothFaces)
```

### C#

```csharp
Feature InsertCutSwept3(
   System.bool Propagate,
   System.bool Alignment,
   System.short TwistCtrlOption,
   System.bool KeepTangency,
   System.bool BAdvancedSmoothing,
   System.short StartMatchingType,
   System.short EndMatchingType,
   System.bool IsThinBody,
   System.double Thickness1,
   System.double Thickness2,
   System.short ThinType,
   System.short PathAlign,
   System.bool UseFeatScope,
   System.bool UseAutoSelect,
   System.double TwistAngle,
   System.bool BMergeSmoothFaces
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
Feature^ InsertCutSwept3(
   System.bool Propagate,
   System.bool Alignment,
   System.short TwistCtrlOption,
   System.bool KeepTangency,
   System.bool BAdvancedSmoothing,
   System.short StartMatchingType,
   System.short EndMatchingType,
   System.bool IsThinBody,
   System.double Thickness1,
   System.double Thickness2,
   System.short ThinType,
   System.short PathAlign,
   System.bool UseFeatScope,
   System.bool UseAutoSelect,
   System.double TwistAngle,
   System.bool BMergeSmoothFaces
)
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Propagate`: True propagates the swept cut to the next edge, false causes the swept cut to occur only on the selected edge; to propagate to the next edge, the next edge must be tangent to the current edge
- `Alignment`: If the curve used to sweep goes from one face to another or from one edge to another, then passing True causes the sweep to cut completely through the end faces of the cut, false causes the swept cut to begin and end perpendicular to the sweep curve; therefore, it may not break through the two end faces of the body being cut
- `TwistCtrlOption`: Twist control options as defined by

[swTwistControlType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swTwistControlType_e.html)
- `KeepTangency`: If the sweep section has tangent segments, True to cause the corresponding surfaces in the resulting sweep to be tangent, false to not
- `BAdvancedSmoothing`: If the sweep section has circular or elliptical arcs, true to approximate the sections and smooth the surfaces, false to not
- `StartMatchingType`: Tangency type as defined by

[swTangencyType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swTangencyType_e.html)
- `EndMatchingType`: Tangency type as defined by

[swTangencyType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swTangencyType_e.html)
- `IsThinBody`: True if this feature is a thin body, false if not
- `Thickness1`: Thickness value for the first direction
- `Thickness2`: Thickness value for the second direction
- `ThinType`: Thin wall type as defined by

[swThinWallType_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swThinWallType_e.html)
- `PathAlign`: Align path type (see

Remarks

)
- `UseFeatScope`: True if the feature only affects selected bodies, false if the feature affects all bodies
- `UseAutoSelect`: True to automatically select all bodies and have the feature affect those bodies, false to select the bodies the feature affects (see

Remarks

)
- `TwistAngle`: If twistCtrlOption set to swTwistControlConstantTwistAlongPath, then specify end twist angle
- `BMergeSmoothFaces`: True to merge smooth faces, false to notParamDesc

### Return Value

Pointer to the

[IFeature](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature.html)

object

## VBA Syntax

See

[FeatureManager::InsertCutSwept3](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~FeatureManager~InsertCutSwept3.html)

.

## Remarks

UseIModelDocExtension::SelectByID2to select the profile and sweep curves. The mark for:

- 1 = Profile selection
- 2 = Guide-curve selection, if provided
- 4 = Sweep path

The PathAlign argument is available when TwistCtrlOption is set to 0 and can take one of these values:

- 0 = None; no correction (default)
- 2 = Direction vector; a plane, planar face, or line defines the path
- 3 = All faces; includes neighboring faces

When UseAutoSelect is false, the user must select the bodies that the feature will affect.

When using cut or cavity features that result in multiple bodies, you cannot select to keep all of the resulting bodies or one or more selected bodies.
