[Create and Edit Limit Distance Mate (C#)](Create_Limit_Distance_Mate_Example_CSharp.htm)

## Remarks

SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IMateFeatureData.html

A distance mate places selected items at a specified distance. A limit distance mate is an advanced mate that allows components to move within a range of distances. Use[IDistanceMateFeatureData::IsAdvancedMate](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IDistanceMateFeatureData~IsAdvancedMate.html)to determine whether this is a limit distance mate.

[IMateFeatureData](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IMateFeatureData.html)is the parent of this mate interface.

To create either a distance mate or a limit distance mate:

1. Follow general instructions in the

  [IAssemblyDoc::CreateMate](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IAssemblyDoc~CreateMate.html)

  Remarks.
2. Specify

  [IDistanceMateFeatureData::EntitiesToMate](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IDistanceMateFeatureData~EntitiesToMate.html)

  or use

  [IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~SelectByID2.html)

  to pre-select the entities using Mark = 1.
3. Specify other properties of the DistanceMateFeatureData object.

To edit a distance mate:

1. Access its feature and call

  [IFeature::GetDefinition](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~GetDefinition.html)

  to get the MateFeatureData object.
2. Cast the MateFeatureData object to a DistanceMateFeatureData object.
3. Modify the DistanceMateFeatureData object.
4. Call

  [IFeature::ModifyDefinition](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html)

  .

To delete a distance mate, use[IModelDocExtension::DeleteSelection2](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDocExtension~DeleteSelection2.html).
