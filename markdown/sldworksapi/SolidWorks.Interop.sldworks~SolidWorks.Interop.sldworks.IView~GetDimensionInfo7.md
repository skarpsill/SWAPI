# GetDimensionInfo7 Method (IView)

Gets all of the dimension information in the current drawing sheet or the current drawing view.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetDimensionInfo7() As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IView
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.GetDimensionInfo7()
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object GetDimensionInfo7()
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.Object^ GetDimensionInfo7();
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Return Value

Array of doubles (see

Remarks

)

## VBA Syntax

See

[View::GetDimensionInfo7](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~View~GetDimensionInfo7.html)

.

## Remarks

The data returned is an array of doubles as follows:

[dimensionCount,[dimensionType, LineStyleIndex, LineWidth, Color, LayerID, LayerOverride, refPoint1a[3], refPoint1b[3], refPoint2a[3], refPoint2b[3], refPoint3[3], textPoint[3], textDirection[3], dimNormal[3], angularDimInfo[9], angularOrdinateDimInfo[10], precision, arrowLength, arrowHeadWidth, arrowHeadHeight, arrowHeadStyle, witnessGap, witnessExt, dimValue, textHeight, arrowsOut, isDiameter, RadialDimensionflags]]

where:

dimensionCount= number of dimensions found in the drawing view

Each dimension has the following data:

dimensionType =returns 0 = Linear, 1 = Angular, 2 = Radial, 3 = Ordinate, 4 = Chamfer, 5 = Angular Ordinate

LineStyleIndex= line style; valid line styles as defined in[swLineStyles_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swLineStyles_e.html)

LineWidth= integer value defining the line width; valid width values as defined in[swLineWeights_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swLineWeights_e.html)

Color= COLORREF returned as an integer; return value could be 0 or -1 for default color

LayerID= integer value indicating which layer holds this entity; this integer value is the array index value into the layerList array; obtain the layerList array using[ILayerMgr::GetLayerList](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ILayerMgr~GetLayerList.html)or[ILayerMgr::IGetLayerList](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ILayerMgr~IGetLayerList.html); a value of 1 indicates that this item is not on a layer

LayerOverride= integer with bit flags set to determine which properties, if any, have been overridden with respect to the[ILayer](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ILayer.html)default properties; if the bit value is set, then the specific property or properties have been overridden; the bit indicators are: color = 0x1, style = 0x2, and width = 0x4; therefore, ifLayerOverridewas returned as 3, you know the color and style have been specifically set for this item and may not match the default values associated with this item's layer

refPoint1a[3]= array of three doubles

refPoint1b[3]= array of three doubles

refPoint2a[3]= array of three doubles

refPoint2b[3]= array of three doubles

refPoint3[3]= array of three doubles

textPoint[3]= array of three doubles; this is the upper-left corner of the dimension bounding box

textDirection[3]= array of three doubles

dimNormal[3]= array of three doubles

angularDimInfo[9]This data is only returned for angular dimensions; the array of 9 values is as follows:

quadrant= as defined in[swQuadant_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swQuadant_e.html)

directionLine1[3] = array of three doubles

directionLine2[3] = array of three doubles

isInteriorAngle= BOOLEAN returned as a double; true if it is an interior angle

isFlipped= BOOLEAN returned as a double; true if it is flipped

angularOrdinateDimInfo[10] This data is only returned for angular ordinate dimiensions; the array of 10 values is as follows:

point[3] = array of three doubles

isPermanent= BOOLEAN returned as a double; true if it is permanent

leaderType= where 1 = Above Text, 2 = Inline Text, 3 = Horizontal Text

isExtThruCenter= BOOLEAN returned as a double; true if the extension line passes through the
center

isBidirectiona= BOOLEAN returned as a double; true if it is bidirectional

direction[3] = array of three doubles

precision= number of decimal places

arrowLength= arrow length

arrowHeadWidth= arrowhead width

arrowHeadHeight= arrowhead height

arrowHeadStyle= arrowhead style as defined in[swArrowStyle_e](ms-its:swconst.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swArrowStyle_e.html)

witnessGap= extension gap

witnessExt= extension's extension

dimValue= dimension value

textHeight= dimension text height

arrowsOut= BOOLEANkadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}returned as a double and is true if the arrows are outside

isDiameter= BOOLEANkadov_tag{{<spaces>}}kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}returned as a double and is used by radial dimensions; if this value is true, then thedimValuereturned is the diameter value, if false, then thedimValuereturned is the radial value

RadialDimensionflags =bit code defining properties for radial dimensions or 0 if the dimension is not radial. This element contains a bitwise OR of the following values:

RADIAL_INSIDE - Specifies that the arrows of the radial dimension are displayed inside the arc/circle.

RADIAL_2ND_ARROW - Specifies that there should be two outside arrows displayed with the radial dimension.

RADIAL_SOLID_LEADER - Specifies that the leader line should be drawn in solid.

RADIAL_CALLOUT - Specifies that there should be text displayed with the dimension.

RADIAL_IS_RADIAL - Specifies that the leader line should remain radial.

RADIAL_IS_BENT - Specifies that the leader line should be bent at the end.

RADIAL_IS_LINEAR - Specifies that the leader line should be straight at the end.

RADIAL_DOC_2ND_ARROW - Specifies that there should be two outside document arrows displayed with the radial dimension.

RADIAL_HAS_SNAPPED_DIR - Specifies that the arrow should snap to the grid.

The maximum number of doubles contained in the array will be (1 +dimensionCount* 52).

This method does not support[hole callouts](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IDisplayDimension~IsHoleCallout.html).
