# LoopEdges Property (IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData)

Gets the edges in the specified loop in this shut-off surface feature.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
ReadOnly Property LoopEdges( _
   ByVal Index As System.Integer _
) As System.Object
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As IShutOffSurfaceFeatureData
Dim Index As System.Integer
Dim value As System.Object

value = instance.LoopEdges(Index)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.object LoopEdges(
   System.int Index
) {get;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.Object^ LoopEdges {
   System.Object^ get(System.int Index);
}
```

NOTE:

See

[Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm)

.

### Parameters

- `Index`: Index of the loop

### Property Value

Array of

[edges](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IEdge.html)

## VBA Syntax

See

[ShutOffSurfaceFeatureData::LoopEdges](ms-its:sldworksapivb6.chm::/sldworks~ShutOffSurfaceFeatureData~LoopEdges.html)
