# GetNominalLine Method (ISwDMDimXpertIntersectLineFeature)

Gets the coordinates and vector for this DimXpert intersect line.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Function GetNominalLine( _
   ByRef X As System.Double, _
   ByRef Y As System.Double, _
   ByRef Z As System.Double, _
   ByRef I As System.Double, _
   ByRef J As System.Double, _
   ByRef K As System.Double _
) As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ISwDMDimXpertIntersectLineFeature
Dim X As System.Double
Dim Y As System.Double
Dim Z As System.Double
Dim I As System.Double
Dim J As System.Double
Dim K As System.Double
Dim value As System.Boolean

value = instance.GetNominalLine(X, Y, Z, I, J, K)
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool GetNominalLine(
   out System.double X,
   out System.double Y,
   out System.double Z,
   out System.double I,
   out System.double J,
   out System.double K
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
System.bool GetNominalLine(
   [Out] System.double X,
   [Out] System.double Y,
   [Out] System.double Z,
   [Out] System.double I,
   [Out] System.double J,
   [Out] System.double K
)
```

### Parameters

- `X`: x coordinate of the intersect line
- `Y`: y coordinate of the intersect line
- `Z`: z coordinate of the intersect line
- `I`: i component of the direction vector of the intersect line
- `J`: j component of the direction vector of the intersect line
- `K`: k component of the direction vector of the intersect line

### Return Value

True if method call is successful; false otherwise
