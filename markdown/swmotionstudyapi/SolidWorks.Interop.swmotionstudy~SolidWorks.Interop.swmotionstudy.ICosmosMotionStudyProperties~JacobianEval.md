# JacobianEval Property (ICosmosMotionStudyProperties)

Gets or sets how often the simulation engine's Jacobian matrix is updated.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property JacobianEval As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICosmosMotionStudyProperties
Dim value As System.Integer

instance.JacobianEval = value

value = instance.JacobianEval
```

### C#

```csharp
System.int JacobianEval {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.int JacobianEval {
   System.int get();
   void set (    System.int value);
}
```

### Property Value

How often, in percent,

kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}

the simulation engine's Jacobian matrix is updated

## VBA Syntax

See

[CosmosMotionStudyProperties::JacobianEval](ms-its:swmotionstudyapivb6.chm::/SwMotionStudy~CosmosMotionStudyProperties~JacobianEval.html)

.

## Remarks

At 100%, the Jacobian is updated at every integration time step. At 50% the Jacobian is updated at every other integration time step. This value impacts models that contain intermittent curve/curve contact. The higher the value, the better the simulation accuracy. However, the higher the value, the greater the impact in the overall simulation time.
