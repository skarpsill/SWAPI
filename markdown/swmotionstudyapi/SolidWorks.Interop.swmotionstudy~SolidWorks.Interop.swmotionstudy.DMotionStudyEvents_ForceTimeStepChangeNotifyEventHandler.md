# DMotionStudyEvents_ForceTimeStepChangeNotifyEventHandler Delegate (SolidWorks.Interop.swmotionstudy)

Fired when a motion study is[calculated](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swmotionstudy~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swmotionstudy.IMotionStudy~Calculate.html)and there are[external forces.](ms-its:sldworksapi.chm::/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISimulationForceFeatureData~ExternalState.html)

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Public Delegate Function DMotionStudyEvents_ForceTimeStepChangeNotifyEventHandler( _
   ByVal Force As System.String, _
   ByVal Time As System.Double, _
   ByRef ForceMagnitude As System.Double _
) As System.Integer
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As New DMotionStudyEvents_ForceTimeStepChangeNotifyEventHandler(AddressOf HandlerMethod)
```

### C#

```csharp
public delegate System.int DMotionStudyEvents_ForceTimeStepChangeNotifyEventHandler(
   System.string Force,
   System.double Time,
   ref System.double ForceMagnitude
)
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
public delegate System.int DMotionStudyEvents_ForceTimeStepChangeNotifyEventHandler(
   System.String^ Force,
   System.double Time,
   System.double% ForceMagnitude
)
```

### Parameters

- `Force`: Force name
- `Time`: Time
- `ForceMagnitude`: New force or torque magnitude

## Visual Basic Application (VBA) Syntax

See

[ForceTimeStepChangeNotify Event (MotionStudy)](ms-its:swmotionstudyapivb6.chm::/SwMotionStudy~MotionStudy~ForceTimeStepChangeNotify_EV.html)

.

## Remarks

If developing a C++ application, then use[swMotionStudyForceTimeStepChangeNotify](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swmotionstudy~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swmotionstudy.swMotionStudyNotify_e.html)to register for this notification.

You can implement any force law after catching this event. The return value is a double that specifies the new force or torque magnitude. This event is called at every major time step from ADAMS.
