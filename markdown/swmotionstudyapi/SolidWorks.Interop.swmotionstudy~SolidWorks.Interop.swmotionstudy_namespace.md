## Delegates

| Delegate | Description |
| --- | --- |
| DMotionStudyEvents_ForceOutputTimeStepChangeNotifyEventHandler | Fired at every integrator or output time step when a motion simulation is occurring and external forces exist. |
| DMotionStudyEvents_ForceTimeStepChangeNotifyEventHandler | Fired when a motion study is calculated and there are external forces. |
| DMotionStudyEvents_MotorOutputTimeStepChangeNotifyEventHandler | Fired at every integrator or output time step when a motion simulation is occurring and external motors exist. |
| DMotionStudyEvents_MotorTimeStepChangeNotifyEventHandler | Fired when a motion study is calculated and there are external motors . |
| DMotionStudyEvents_OutputTimeStepChangeNotifyEventHandler | Fired at every integrator or output time step when a motion simulation is occurring. |
| DMotionStudyEvents_PartCollideNotifyEventHandler | Fired when a collision between two components occurs. |
| DMotionStudyEvents_SpecialMotionEventNotifyEventHandler | Fired for motion-related special events, such as contacts. |
