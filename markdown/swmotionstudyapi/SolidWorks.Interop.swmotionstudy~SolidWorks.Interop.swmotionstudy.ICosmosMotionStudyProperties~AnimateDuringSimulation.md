# AnimateDuringSimulation Property (ICosmosMotionStudyProperties)

Gets or sets whether to show the motion during the calculation of the simulation.

## Syntax

### Visual Basic (Declaration)

```vb
Property AnimateDuringSimulation As System.Boolean
```

### Visual Basic (Usage)

```vb
Dim instance As ICosmosMotionStudyProperties
Dim value As System.Boolean

instance.AnimateDuringSimulation = value

value = instance.AnimateDuringSimulation
```

### C#

```csharp
System.bool AnimateDuringSimulation {get; set;}
```

### C++/CLI

```cpp
property System.bool AnimateDuringSimulation {
   System.bool get();
   void set (    System.bool value);
}
```

### Property Value

True to show the motion during the calculation of the simulation, false to not and speed up the calculation time
